"E-Zee M.Fort Worth, TX939611839/3/20183 photosTonight was a very bad night for customer service at this location. I entered the location looked around maybe about 30 people inside and they had about eight waitresses available, and everything looked OK. It took the waitress about 15 minutes to stop and see me after I started giving her strange looks. So I ordered a Pepsi,  chicken wings and a shrimp stirfry. It seems like a simple enough order but it took another five minutes to get the drink in almost 20 to 25 minutes for the wings and at the one hour and 10 minute limit I said that was enough in my main dish still has not arrived. Poor customer service is not an excuse for any business.Useful 8Funny 2Cool 3Business owner informationSamantha B.Business Owner9/15/2018Hey Elbert, That is not the experience we wanted you to have and we want to look into this for you.

"Shea S.Elite '2021Granville, OH2531584668/21/20175 photosI was in the area checking out the dealership for a potential investment opportunity and decided what better way to see the current situation than to use the service department. I took my wife's 2015 Sorento in for service and was greeted with a big smile and hand shake. The car needed an oil change and tire rotation, they explained the process and had me sit in the customer lounge. The lounge is AWESOME, nice furniture, free WIFI and a nice selection of coffee's and snacks. I made a Starbucks with the coffee machine and grabbed a granola bar and about 50 min later they had completed my service. The car was washed and they even swept it out. I definitely think this is a great place to do business and could be a great place to work.See all photos from Shea S. for Ken Ganley KiaUseful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationNikolaus N.Business Manager9/5/2017Shea, we appreciate you taking the time to share your review!

"Mark Y.Erin Mills, Mississauga, Canada018/4/2019Good suit but it ruined my experience during my sister's wedding as the groomsman.I went to do fitting 2 months ago for the initial fitting for the rental, and another time 2 weeks ago for the final fitting.I received the tuxedo, and on the wedding day, the jacket did NOT fit all, the jacket buttons wouldn't even come close to each other. I had to walk down the aisle with an unbuttoned jacket!And after a few hours, the jacket ripped from the side! It ruined many photoshoots cause my left side was pretty bad and can't show it on the camera :/The tux looked nice but the fitting for the jacket was VERY bad. And the small extra fancy buttons are too small to keep my shirt buttoned.

"John S.Charlotte, NC21512/29/2017If there was a way to give zero or negative stars I would. I'll keep this brief since I've had multiple horrible experiences with this place. They have done about everything wrong I can think of, from horrible customer service, terrible communication to what seems to me to be complete incompetence in actually doing repairs. I have taken my car to them three times for overheating issues. They initially replaced my radiator and sold me on a repair to my front end. The next day I had to get my car towed because they did not tighten something properly, which they admitted and fixed. Another trip in for the same overheating issue and this time they replaced the water pump, but not the thermostat, even though that was their initial diagnosis of the problem. My best guess why they didn't replace the thermostat is they don't talk to each other, or not very effectively. I was transferred to four different people over the course of several days trying to get my car fixed. That repair took, wait for it......FOUR DAYS!!! That was not bad enough, though, because my car was overheating again not long after they replaced the water pump and this time they told me someone had put ""stop leak"" in my cooling system and it would cost over $1,700 to ""clean it out"". Thankfully, I smelled a scam and took my car elsewhere and had the system flushed and the thermostat replaced for about $200 and my car now runs fine. I will never take my car to a Pep Boys again and I would not let them work on my car for free. I felt like I was treated unethically and I warn everyone to think twice before taking your car to Pep Boys.Useful 5Funny 1CoolBusiness owner informationPep B.Business Owner12/30/2017John, every Pep Boys customer deserves to be treated with respect and provided the services promised.

He also saw that my value cover gaskets were leaking! He also told me I didn't need a brake master cylinder, but I did need just front brakes!Tanner replaced my front brakes and resurfaced my rotors!Tina the asst manager, made sure that I was able to apply my Just Brakes wannaties,  all the work was going to be completed that day, and have my truck would be back to me before a event that I had to attend that evening!She also made it possible for Lyft to take me home while the work was being done on my truck and then pick me up again!Today I told Mark Davis the store manager, the fact that Tanner was able to address and fix my check engine light issues was enough for me to come back the next time I'm in town!With the new shocks and brakes my truck rides like its brand new!Thank you again Tina, Tanner and Mark for your outstanding customer service!You guys totally Rocks!UsefulFunnyCool 1Business owner informationPep B.Business Owner8/8/2018When our customers are happy, we are happy.

"Christa L.San Tan Valley, AZ84637019645/25/20161 photoWhat a great sandwich shop!  There are so many amazing options...both with meat or without.  And the service is amazing.  The guys who work the front counter make you feel like you're visiting a friend's home.  They are super interactive, enthusiastic, and friendly and they treat each customer the same way, even when they are incredibly busy and the line is out the door.  And despite the lunch crowd, the sandwiches were still delivered in a reasonable amount of time.  Nice job guys!I ordered the Scotsman, which was pretty good.  All veggies were super fresh as was the bread.  Oh, and when they ask if you want your bread toasted, your answer should always be yes.  I only have a couple of complaints, which is why one star is missing.  First off, my sandwich was supposed to come with pesto, which it did because I could see it.  Unfortunately, I really couldn't taste it.  And I found that pretty strange because pesto has such a strong distinct flavor.  The other thing was that the sandwich was SO messy.  It literally fell apart and was more like a salad with a side of bread.  Overall though, I'd definitely recommend stopping in and I hope to return to try some of their other delicious sounding menu items.The Scotsman and potato saladUseful 12Funny 7Cool 10Business owner informationAmber W.Business Owner5/25/2016What a GREAT REVIEW!

The blend of chicken and roast beef with the silly sauce made for a real treat. My wife had the French Dip. She said the Beef had a good flavor, and the au jous was very nice and flavorful. She is really picky so for her to like it tells me it was top shelf. The crew was quick and attentive.  The facility was clean and well lit.

The menu alone is quite extensive, comparable only to another mile high menu Ikes out of Tempe. After deliberating over 100+ sandwiches, ordered the 'Hat Trick'. To my surprise, was perfect. Was almost like a Alfredo pasta squaw with chicken toasted bread. Where to go wrong? The only reason I can't give it a 5 stars, it appeared understaffed & just a few minor details that matter. Plus $14 & some change is a little much for a young man like myself.

"Ervin S.Toronto, Canada027/7/2015Honestly, this doesn't even deserve 1 star..I recently bought 3 bottles of their house juice. They told me it was 70/30 Vg/Pg ratio, and I asked for 3mg..First, All flavours sucked. Juice is runny, and vapour production isn't good which leads me to believe it is 50/50 ratio. I asked for 3mg specifically but I get unbelievably uncomfortable throat hits... Terrible. Definitely not 3mg, possibly 6mg or higher. Flavours were also not as described. Shitty products aside, customer service was also terrible. The girl was nice, but the other guy was rude. I said good morning and he didn't even look at me or acknowledge my presence.  I felt generally uncomfortable in this shop.. The only reason why I bought the juices anyway was because I was out of juice, and the description sounded good. No dripping samples either.Will not be returning to this shop, and I encourage everybody to find somewhere else to shop for vape products.  Seriously, terrible environment. Very unwelcoming.UsefulFunny 2CoolBusiness owner informationTommy T.Business Owner7/7/2015Hi Ervin, I'm terribly sorry you feel this way about us.

Third, I will agree that our 3mg is slightly stronger than most 3's out there, but if you would like to come try a 6mg I guarantee you it will be stronger than the juice you just purchased.

"Jessica K.Scottsdale, AZ3057610/19/2014I lived in Village at Lakewood for approx 9 months and I moved out in 2013.  The location is great.  I really loved the neighborhood.  Being able to walk my dog every morning and evening on the greenway was a treat.  The complex was ok.  The security gates on the parking lots always worked but 50% of the sidewalk gates were broken.  Not nice to know the complex wasn't secure but, nice to not have to carry my keys when out walking the dog.  The pools were always clean and the landscaping was cared for.The unit I moved into was extremely dated.  Old carpet, ancient kitchen appliances, and terrible windows.  It also turned out to have a major roach (water bug) infestation.  How they hid it when I did my walk through, I don't know. Pest control was in my apartment every other week - spraying, drilling holes in the walls and fogging, doing everything they could do - but the bugs wouldn't go.  The living room window leaked water when rain water would run down the front of the building.  Luckily, the outgoing management let me out of my lease before the new management came in.  The roaches avoided my bedroom, which I thought was awfully nice of them.  To be fair, my neighbors claimed to not have the same level of roach infestation that I did.  People on the second floor, directly above my unit, claimed to have never even seen a roach before!  Guess I was just lucky.Minus the bugs, I liked the apartment and the management was very responsive.  It was really quiet and my neighbors were very nice.  Price wise, considering the dated fixtures and bug problem, I paid too much for that little one bedroom.  I went into the complex a few weeks ago to visit a friend and saw that they had my old unit torn apart.  Hopefully its been completely gutted, not just cleaned to turn it over again and let another poor soul deal with the infestation.Useful 6Funny 1CoolBusiness owner informationErica M.Business Owner3/8/2015Thank you for taking the time to make a review.  We are sorry that we were not able to make the bug issue go away for you but we are happy that we were able to come to a solution that both parties were happy with.  We are doing some great renovations to the interior of the apartments that make a huge improvement.  Next time you are in the area visiting your friend, stop in the office and take a look for yourself.  Thank you again for the review.Read more","Business owner informationErica M.Business Owner3/8/2015Thank you for taking the time to make a review.  We are sorry that we were not able to make the bug issue go away for you but we are happy that we were able to come to a solution that both parties were happy with.  We are doing some great renovations to the interior of the apartments that make a huge improvement.  Next time you are in the area visiting your friend, stop in the office and take a look for yourself.  Thank you again for the review.Read more"
"Paul T.Phoenix, AZ2189/20/2015Please accept this short testament of a very personal nature that speaks to the Village at Lakewood's staff.This has absolutely nothing to do w/ bathroom tub caulking; ceiling fan squeaks; pristine pool facilities; loud or quiet neighbors; excessive leaf blowing vs. excessive leaves; excellent, exclusive, taxpayer-rebate-funded (parochial/cult) schools vs. traditionally funded and notoriously neglected (pubic) schools for normal kids; creepy cupboard crawlies or any other such weighty matters.I'd like to thank Wes, a member of the Village at Lakewood office staff, for his professional and discrete handling of an extremely urgent matter that a clearly distraught, non-resident walk-in dumped on his Monday morning desk.Without hesitation and with some authority (no doubt guided by his years of industry experience) Wes rose to the occasion, followed procedure, enlisted the resources of the community, directed activities as necessary and calmly offered comfort and assistance to this complete stranger under duress.Here's where I pull off my ""Undercover Boss"" disguise and present Wes with a full year membership to the ""Jelly of the Month Club"", right?  Hold on a sec...That was real life on the phone.  They're out of jelly.  So I'll leave you with this instead:Imagine how well the actual Village at Lakewood tenants are served if the Village staff perform this highly for a stranger in need.Thank you, Wes and Village management for your assistance.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationErica M.Business Owner9/21/2015Thank you for taking the time to complete a positive review for our community and most of all for one of our team members.  We do strive to provide exceptional customer service to all who visit The Village at Lakewood and we appreciate your kind words and recognition in doing so.Best regards,Erica MirelesVillage at Lakewood Community Manager480-642-9700villagelakewoodmgr@greys…Read more","Business owner informationErica M.Business Owner9/21/2015Thank you for taking the time to complete a positive review for our community and most of all for one of our team members.  We do strive to provide exceptional customer service to all who visit The Village at Lakewood and we appreciate your kind words and recognition in doing so.Best regards,Erica MirelesVillage at Lakewood Community Manager480-642-9700villagelakewoodmgr@greys…Read more"
"Bahi S.Glendale, AZ025/13/2016I was excited when I was out of my last lease to find a better location and home for my little family. When I had the walk through here at Lakewood I was So excited and eager to get approved and move in! Just my luck... This place is worst than living in my last 4 bedroom home in Laveen! I settled for small, BUT I didn't expect to have my carpet poking my kids and I in the feet, our cabinets peeling from being painted over, a washer that stinks when you wash clothes(what's he point of washing clothes??), the bathroom tubs scoff bc they were painted, my AC unit is ALWAYS leaking water AND the thermostat control doesn't work properly(I have to hit it to make it work), and the drains are all plugged up(continuously), and when your microwave is a Kenmore brand when you get it and it breaks they replace it with a cheap ass microwave! After all these things I for sure pay WAY too much rent for a place like this!!! Management doesn't do much bc they don't work with you and the maintenance line is retarded bc they just call you back and make you feel stupid!.... Example: your AC unit is leaking really bad at 8pm... They call you and tell you to put something under it like a pot and they'll come by first thing tomorrow morning! It's annoying... So whoever reads this you are forewarned!! Do not rent from here! I wish I would've just done a month to month plan bc I've only been here for 2 months and can't stand it!Useful 2FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationErica M.Business Owner5/16/2016Thank you for taking the time to review our community.

"Felicia T.Phoenix, AZ03155/14/2015I have lived in the complex for 10 months now and would caution new residentsPros:-Great location close to the greenbelt and the lakes.-Quiet complex, I rarely hear noise from other residents that bothers me.-Residents are friendly and there are lots of kids for the little ones to play with.-Maintenance is quick to respond to minor repairs.Cons:-Remodeling job is cheap.  They are just spray painting the old cabinets and putting down cheap laminate and linoleum.  The cabinets stick and the spray paint comes off in little flecks and the flooring scratches and scuffs really easily. -If you are on the first floor, the landscaping crew blows all of the leaves and debris onto the patios  -Even though they have a ban on pit bulls, I see a lot of them in the complex-Jessica is right, most of the sidewalk gates are broken.  One has been broken for  a long time and I talked to management about several months ago- it's still not fixed.-I used to do property management in Texas, and I have never encountered management that is so unreasonable to work with on major issues.  In the 6 months of living here, I had the complex provided washing machine malfunction twice causing damage both times.  The second time it flooded the apartment so badly that we had to remove all of our belongings and stay in a hotel for two weeks while the damage was repaired.  Despite promises from the property manager at the time that we would be reimbursed for hotel expenses, they refused.  The management did not pay for our hotel or pro-rate our rent for the time that we couldn't live there.  That's right we had to pay for a hotel and rent at the same time!  The new manager told me it is their policy not to pay for hotel expenses or pro-rate rent, and that the old manager mispoke.  I've never heard of any landlord with that policy!  Luckily we have good renters insurance through State Farm and they took care of us, but it took 3 weeks to get reimbursed.  The repairs weren't fixed very well either.  They didn't want to replace the carpet, but it couldn't be stretched anymore, so they literally nailed the carpet down.  There are little nails that poke your feet in certain spots and the linoleum was cut jagged and is unsightly.    You'll probably be okay if you don't have any major issues, but I would make sure you have good renters insurance if you choose to live here!Useful 9FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationGreystar M.Business Owner8/2/2016Your experiences and opinions while living here are valuable to us.

"Claire B.Huntersville, NC047/27/2020Thieves, honestly. Would avoid at all costs. They ""fixed"" my car for almost $4,000 and the band-aid they used lasted about four months. Took the car back when I was about to try and sell it and they called saying XYZ was wrong with it... Which they said they had ""replaced and fixed"" a few months before. So when I said that the repair was done by them, the mechanic said ""oh yeah, I'll tighten that up for you"". I wonder if they would have let me pay for them to ""fix"" it again if I didn't remember they already scammed me for it.

"Danny H.FL, FL6211/27/2019These guys trying to charge me 1100 for a fuel pump that I didn't need there was nothing wrong with it. The mark up on the pump it self was more then double what it cost. They tried to give me the excuse that it came with their 2 year 24,000 mile warranty knowing that I'm not from Charlotte and would never be able to use that warranty. I paid them the 130.00 diagnostic fee and took it to the Nissan dealer where they found water in the fuel line. They drained the lines added a fuel treatment charge 125.00 checked fuel pump all was good problem solved.

"Andrew P.Harrisburg, NC117138446/5/2019I've been searching for a trustworthy and reliable mechanic for quite a while now, and have bounced around to all your typical car mechanic chains (Pepboys, Mieneke, etc.). To no avail, every time I went to one of those places with my car, I always walked out disappointed because of the service, quality of work, cost for labor, or a little bit of all 3. I'm happy to say I finally found what I was looking for with Christian Brothers Automotive. Lenny and Scott took great care of my car, and fixed everything I needed in a timely fashion. They were able to do front and back suspension, as well as replace a part that was giving off a check engine light in less than 24 hours. I greatly appreciated the correspondence throughout the entire process to let me know the updates with my car, and I thought it was very convenient that they offer a complimentary shuttle so you don't have to wait around while your car is getting worked on. They did such a great job that I came back the very next day to get front brakes and rotors done that they also got done in an extremely timely fashion. All of these parts needed to get done on my car for a while, and I was completely aware of it, so I know I wasn't taken advantage of like a lot of other mechanics tend to do to people. They kindly let me know of other services my car could benefit from in the not to distant future, but they weren't pushy at all for me to do it right away. Very satisfied! I made sure to let them know that they gained a long term customer in me! Highly recommend. Also, I think it's worth noting that the company's values are centered around Christian beliefs, so if you're looking for humble, honest, and straight forward car service, this is the place to go!Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationCustomer S.Business Owner6/7/2019Andrew, your review is such a joy to receive!

"Mizzle D.Fort Ogden, FL051/30/2017I lived here about 4 years ago and I loved it. The entire apartment was very roomy and it felt like a real home. Large kitchen, tons of cabinet space, large pantry, full size washer and dryer and a walk-out patio, professional staff and well-kept grounds and pool area, and relatively quiet neighbors. What more could a person want in an apartment? I would still be living there if I hadn't lost my job. I am now in the market again for a new place and, of course, I checked here. I was so disappointed to hear how high the rent has climbed. The going rate at Lemon and Pear Tree Apartments is now $900/month, which doesn't include water, sewage or trash. YIKES.

"Jenny B.Gilbert, AZ064/1/2021My home was due for preventative termite treatment, so based on the # of & quality of reviews I found on google, yelp, & BBB, I came up with a list of 5 companies to contact.  After my conversation with Jon at Arizona Pest Solutions, he was #1 on my list.  Not only did he patiently answer all of my questions but he went above & beyond to add some context to the answers he was providing.  I could also tell from his responses that he was incredibly knowledgeable & had been doing this for a long time!Of the 5 companies I called, I had 4 come out to do an inspection so they could present me with a quote.  I liked Jon just as much in person as I did over the phone...all of the qualities I remembered from our earlier conversation were there in person as well.  To top it off, his quote ended up being the best of the 4 I received.  The technician (I think his name was Will) who did the treatment was pleasant & efficient.  And can't leave out Valerie in the office...my interactions with her over the phone were very pleasant & she was always very prompt to get back with me.Happy I found this company!  Hint to any potential new customers looking for preventative termite treatment...they had a $100 off coupon on their website for new customers, so be sure to check & see if something is out there for you!UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationKelly B.Business Owner4/15/2021Jenny,WOW, thank you for your AWESOME review!

"Tara S.Bridgeport, CT518767/6/2020We noticed some bugs in our bathrooms and reached out for a quote. AZ Pest Solutions was prompt in their response and able to set up an appointment for us within a couple days. We worked with Vincent and Chad, both of whom were friendly and accommodating to our requests as we have a baby and cats in the home. One time, the week after they had sprayed, a huge pest appeared from the bathroom and they were swift to provide service the following day at no charge to us. They also were good about wearing masks for Covid spread prevention. Valerie in the office was very helpful!

"Sarah A.Elite '2021Toronto, Canada167132253/31/20191 photoAs someone who grew up with Italian bakeries at every corner and had multiple options to choose from for various cold cuts, pastries and goods, I know my point of view may be a bit differet than those who to an Italian bakery as a curiosity. Please note that weekends and in particular Sundays, are busy Italian bakery days. So, my question is how in the world is only having one cashier, one person at the pastry booth, 5 people behind the bar chatting and giggling excusable? Those lines here are brutal and not to mention, people simply toss manners and decorum out the window to get theri hands on whatever dessert they want (usually not even the traditional Italian desserts funny enough).The food...It is overpriced, not gonna lie. Is it the best quality? No. Are the products hard to find? In Corso Italia? No but elsewhere in the city? Probably if Little Italy is excluded. Foods to avoid: the bread (it will harden in a day), soft cheeses (the thickness of the film gives it a spooky feel), the coffee (I would skip it), and the cold cuts probably to avoid the cost for something unlikely to be of the freshest quality. Foods to get: A Zeppole (although it will be moister than others), the Tiramisu could be worse but most definitely could be better, and chocolates or pre-packed goods that are from Italia.The service...For the 70 dollars I spent on a birthday cake, I would have hoped for at the bare minimum a closed box. I understand that no one wants things squished and smashed. However, why not place the cake in a bigger box? I asked for a bag since it took me well over an hour to reach my designation of this bakery...Denied. When I asked for a bag, just give me a big bag. I saw people with small items leave with huge bags given to them by the cashier. I informed the cashier that I was traveling all the way down to the waterfront/lakeshore. I got two random answers that equated to too bad, so sad, good luck. So a 70 dollar cake PLUS the 21 dollar Uber down to my place because I guess hindsight is 20/20 and I should've brought my own bag. Not.Worth.It. Next time, I will just go to a nearby place and get some cupcakes or something. If you were like me looking for a cannoli cake, there are other bakeries in the city that make them. At the length of time and aggravation this trek costed me, I will simply go to Vaughan next time for something akin to what I ordered.We love a well-placed saran wrapUseful 2Funny 2Cool 1Business owner informationAnnaMarie D.Business Owner4/2/2019We take our feedback seriously but we’re not going to take this one to heart.

"Heather G.Las Vegas, NV822186/3/2020I recently had a procedure @ Advanced Dermatology to remove some moles that need to be checked for cancer.

"Christine S.Gilbert, AZ41175325/15/2018Good:  Nice staff.  Flexible lease terms.  Apartments have good space w balconies.  Maintenance issues are handled quickly and responsive.  Office is great to receive and sign off packages.  Grounds are clean.  We love the feral cats.  Lots of the people do.  We rescued an injured one.  You can't pet them because they'll run but you do get to know them and their babies.  It would be great if Mark Taylor partnered w a rescue group that could spay and return them.  They had food trucks too.  Anywhere from 1-4 times per month.Opportunities:  lots of fees that aren't part of their advertising.  So there is a valet waste fee but I was like 20 feet from garbage.  To my knowledge they didn't take recycle.  And I put my bath garbage in there one night and they took the big bag but not that one.  One Monday, they didn't pick it up at all.  And they don't collect Friday or Saturday.  I travelled and some months never used it.  Either build it into rent or get rid of this mandatory fee.   They implemented some required insurance.  You can do a deposit or they offer some no refund option.  I opted for a deposit.The other admin fee was with the monthly water bill.  That was also $25 plus tax monthly admin.  My actual water bill was $5 because of my work schedule but every month I paid $40.Appliances could use an update.  My washer and dryer made some whining sounds.  Two stove burners didn't work.  Microwave would burn food during reheat.  Dishwasher soap dispenser never worked.Parking...I don't know how many people hit the poles for covered parking.  At least 3 that I personally talked.  Think they should get thinner beams, pad them or remove the covered.  Could always be an option for $20 per month for tiny cars.No good cable options.  The service through that cable company is bad.Grounds are nice with a dog park, Volleyball courts and trail.Useful 2FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationSamantha A.Business Owner3/25/2019Christine, Thank you for taking the time to share this very thoughtful review with both compliments and suggestions.

"Kimberly W.Manhattan, NY2212/2/2017This property has feral cats running all over getting into garbage and tracking all over your car making the complex smell like cat urine in places. With all the cats you would think there wouldn't be such a scorpion issue but guess again. I had scorpions in and outside of my apartment. The complex does offer Burns pest control weekly at no extra cost, however their services don't really cover getting rid of them just their food source. There is constant turn over in the leasing office which works to your advantage in a way because some of them are really nice and helpful and some are really snooty, but don't worry they wont be there long anyway. Apparently the corporate office doesn't treat the employees any better than the residents.Speaking of the corporate office..be ready to get juiced out of every penny possible at move out. They changed the polices on some of their refundable deposits over the course of my lease and guess what??? All of a sudden it's no longer refundable! I would give the corporate office a negative star if i could. They don't care at all if you have paid your rent on time and have been a model tenet, you are a number and there are more of you out there, so what do they care? More than anything I'm really disappointed in the way the corporation treated me, but I guess that's how the fat cats stay fat.Useful 3FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationMark T.Business Manager2/9/2017Thank you for reaching out, Kimberly.

"Samantha M.Gilbert, AZ301121/1/2017I have lived here for almost 4 years now and it is time to move on. I actually love the apartments, but what ruined it for me is the following:1. CATS. There are feral cats everywhere. They live in the exterior walls of the apartment and breed. People in the complex feed them as well. I have personally called Borrego about this on multiple occasions over the past year and a half and they have chosen to do nothing. Now, there are upwards of 20 cats that live near my building alone. It is to the point where they sleep on my car every night and have ruined the paint on the hood of my car. They a very territorial and will lurk in the stairwells and hallways and hiss at you if you try to go up/down the stairs to get to your apartment. They will also rummage through the trashcans outside resident's doors before they are picked up by the trash service. 2. The front office. The staff itself are nice for the most part. The issue I have is the fact that my rent is always wrong. On several occasions they have added fees into my rent and I've had to play phone tag with them to get these mysterious fees taken off my account. They also rarely get my rent correct on the first try and on the 1st of every month I spend my day trying to get the amount corrected before I start getting charged late fees waiting on them to correct their error. Additionally, it's frustrating that I'm charged an admin fee every month when I have to manually check everything they charge me for mistakes because it is rarely correct. 3. Rent increases every year to the point that it's no longer competitive with newer, larger, upgraded apartments. If you have time to kill and can baby sit Mark Taylor, then I say live here. If you also have no regard for your property or personal safety, this is a great place to live. I'm disappointed that these simple issues could not be addressed in the time I lived here because I love the location and I love the floor plan of my apartment.

"Mike S.Charlotte, NC054/19/2021Have had two very bad experiences with them in the past couple of months. Having been priority advantage member, I used them for plumbing and AC for past few years. Recent plumbing experience technician quoted $700 to sleeve a main drain pipe. Fifteen minutes late he had broken the entire pipe and it was $3,700. All he could say was ""sorry, I won't charge you for the damage I did"".Next AC came out for annual service, and granted unit is old and I expected the possibility to replace. Technician said it was needed to be replaced, and I asked if it could still be charged with Freon and he quoted $3000 to charge it. Called some manager who got me on the phone to schedule a quote for system replacement. Get on the phone and he wants to schedule someone to call me on phone, not come out!? I said, whatever, just call after 5 Monday. Billy called and didn't ask any info, just said $10,950. So I have four other companies out since and not one quoted more than $4000 LESS than Morris Jenkins.

"Warren E.Mesa, AZ80172410/23/20163 photosI wanted to wait a full 6 months to make an honest review. I didn't want to review something after a few months. After all, you lose a lot of the water weight first, then the hard weight loss comes after.  Before joining, I accepted the fact that being large & overweight was just going to be a way of life. This also took a toll on my self esteem and other aspects of my life. I had no desire to look in the mirror where I had to pre stretch my clothes for them to fit ""better"".  Due to my weight at the time, I had to take medicine to control my acid reflux and blood pressure. Which also includes a few low blood sugar episodes (hypoglycemic) Then came my breaking point... I finally looked at myself in the mirror after years of a poor diet and zero excercise. Disappointed & disgusted in myself for letting me get so badly out of shape. My wife and I decided (after ""bugging me"" constantly) to start to get back into shape. We wanted to kickstart our weight loss and what better way than a trainer offering the first 4 weeks free (after a few waivers are signed). I can now say after 6 months of hard work, I have lost over 33 pounds, over 58 total inches, lost 3.8% body fat and 19 of those pounds were nothing but fat. I've lost almost 8 inches around my waist, 9 inches around my gut, 6 inches around my chest and hips. I can go on and on.Because of Jennifer, my clothes no longer need to be pre-stretched. no longer do I have to hold my breath to tie my shoes. No longer do I have to hope my button on my pants break loose. No longer do I have the desire to eat bad food. I was starting to wear XXXL shirts to hide my ""fat feelings"" now I can almost (depending on who makes it) wear a XL shirt. I still have a long way to go in my weight loss. I have made friends here that need the same thing and even though I will still come to My Perfect Body Now Boot Camp for years to come, I will never be able to thank Jennifer enough what what she's given me in just the short amount of time. She's given me my self esteem back, self confidence back, my waist line back . Just to name a few. But the absolutely best part is I no longer have to take any medications for blood pressure or acid reflux.Useful 2FunnyCool 1Business owner informationJennifer S.Business Owner10/23/2016We are sooo grateful for you Warren!

"Liz E.Phoenix, AZ266135/27/2016My husband and I were searching for a gym and personal trainer and we're lucky to have come across this boot camp. We just finished our first month and I can say this boot camp is now something we look forward to everyday. My husband and I were terrified because we are very overweight and saw everyone doing things we thought was just impossible. But everyone was so supportive and encouraging and Jennifer was there everyday to cheer us on (she even memorized our names on day one) and make sure we didn't give up. After one month and going everyday my husband lost 22.25 total inches and I lost an incredible 28 inches and 1% body fat. The normal is about 10"" a month so these results were amazing and have really motivated us to keep up the hard work. Join the class, come everyday, be positive and give it all you got and you won't be sorry! Everyday is a different workout so you are constantly using different muscles. Even if you can only do one rep of something over time you can do more and more, don't get discouraged.PS did I mention Jennifer is amazing?!Useful 1FunnyCool 2Business owner informationJennifer S.Business Owner5/28/2016Thank you so much for the fantastic review of your Boot Camp experience with My Perfect Body Now Fitness Boot Camps.

"Jamie W.Queen Creek, AZ2432632/27/2018I am so happy that I stumbled upon this boot camp! After never working out before I was terrified to start! My first day was tough but Jennifer and the whole team were SO welcoming and so encouraging that I never once felt uncomfortable. After 4 weeks I have found Jennifer's boot camp to be the best thing for me. I already see outstanding improvements in my body, my endurance, and my mental health. I want to share just ONE of the ways that Jennifer helped restore my confidence - I have had knee issues in the past and sure enough, my right knee started to become aggravated. I was so worried that I was going to have to leave boot camp for a while but instead Jennifer took the time to work with me and she figured out exactly what the issue was!! I couldn't believe it! If it weren't for her there is NO way I could've continued. Seriously though, Jennifer is awesome and the team is awesome too. It's so awesome working out with others that are so encouraging and motivating. Thank you Jennifer, I am so excited for what the future holds!Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationJennifer S.Business Owner3/3/2018I appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with our FREE 4 week Boot Camp and even more excited to have you stay on board for another 12 weeks!

"Jessie B.Gilbert, AZ0329/22/2013This review has been so long past due. I went to this bootcamp for around six months and I LOVED every second of it. Jennifer is extremely supportive and takes the time to get to know each of her members. She knew me by name after my first day! Each workout is different and never gets boring. Jennifer varies her workouts daily to target muscles strategically.  One of my favorite things about this bootcamp is that every workout is an entire hour. From the moment you get there to the moment you leave, you are sweating. I can definitely say that I am a much healthier and fitter person because of her. I had to leave because of a new work schedule, but this bootcamp gave me such an awesome foundation of how I should be working out.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationJennifer S.Business Owner12/16/2013Thank you Jessica!!!

"Brenda V.Las Vegas, NV61218/22/2019Bar none the most reliable service out there. I had used care.com for the first two years before finding college nannies and sitter. Yes, it was less money but let's face it you get what you pay for. College nannies has NEVER let me down. Their sitters have always shown up on time and it's such a relief to know they will find me a sitter if something comes up. Their sitter are fantastic with my son. They work with his reading and writing and play with him while I'm gone. I think he may prefer it when I'm gone just to have a sitter. I have never been less stress to leave my child in the care of one of these sitter.

"WtGEnt E.Miami, FL110163/18/20195 photosBLIND DRAGON ALLOWED THIS SCAM ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY TO HOST IN THERE RESTAURANTBamboozled the fuck out of me & many others. Showed up for there R&B / Seafood Dinner event. Spent $110 for two. Expectations? Open champagne bar for 2 hours that was non existent. One drink minimum per person and after that they charge you at bar. I will being requesting a reverse transaction with my bank immediately. They ran out of champagne also. The catering @hotgrill was fucking off and didn't get our food until almost 9PM after I sat down and got only one drink at exactly 5:09PM. Guy name Roderick in the photo walking around looking like Nick Cannons ass motherfucker trying to calm everyone down while he had his affiliates running around looking dumb as fuck. His excuse was we affiliated with Michaels Downtown due to them closing for financial mismanagement issues. Bro that ain't even our issue here. While we strive hard to support black owned businesses you clearly make it hard. @hot97 back in NYC; same scenario. Lured a bunch of party goers onto a yacht and didn't have enough food and overpriced the fuck out of fucking liquor. Terrible way to manage this event. I will be avoiding this event indefinitely. Whoever attended the Scottsdale @blinddragon even this was wack as fuck. Coming from NYC this was total bullshit. Oh btw when I complained about not getting now champagne Roderick whoever the fuck he is excuse was that he had to run and buy champagne elsewhere to provide for the patrons. SMFH! Music was off!

"Terrence F.MI, MI934431/14/20191 photoThe Warning: Just like Lil S said before in another review on 1/7/19. There is a reason why they are only open 15 hours a week. I'll never go back and neither will anyone from our group. I would give them ""0"" stars if I could. I was in from out of state and getting married two weeks ago, 1/4/19. My wife reserved the largest room (says it should fit 20 people). This was supposed to be a great fun time for our party after our reception... needless to say they failed right from the start and throughout the night. ON TOP of all of the issues with the place I will describe below, they charge a mandatory 20% gratuity (which they did NOT earn at all).Issue 1...""our reserved room wasn't ready""... We arrived on time for our 10pm-12am reservation, but we had to all stand around awkwardly as there was still another group in our room. This required us to wait while they kicked them out AND ""cleaned"" the room. (was just a quick wipe and no vacuuming).Issue 2...""thought I got robbed""... When the room was ready the woman told me I had to give an ID and a credit card for the room. This is fine, but turns out that woman was let off early, so at the end of the night I'm trying to find someone that I met for 5 seconds that has my ID and Credit Card. On top of that, I asked one of the managers where the woman was and he at first had no recollection of who I was talking about. Eventually they did. But in the meantime I was scared I had just been fleeced out of my worth.Issue 3... ""No instructions/menus/explanations""... there was no one to explain food or drinks or no menus in the room. No one was there to explain how to operate the karaoke system. The 2 microphones they had were super beat up, dented and gross. The walls had ""patch marks"" where they patched and repainted, which was just very raw and unprofessional for the amounts they charge.Issue 4... ""Literally No Service until we complained""... We figured we'd get some liquid courage while we wait. They only had one bartender on duty on a Friday night at 10pm when they were expecting a large wedding party and had the other karaoke rooms full with groups. We patiently waited, and waited...and waited. The bartender did not move from her far corner where she served the 4 people who stood there chatting with her. I had to go out to the bar and ask 3 different people for drinks and why there was not a server in the booked room. Not even waters. I (The groom, had to run back and forth with handfuls of drinks and waters multiple times just so people wouldn't dehydrate in a box) ***Side note, how do you expect some people to sing karaoke without booze? Turns out some women in our party ordered drink right when we got there, but they had no servers so when I went to the bar their drinks had just been sitting up on the bar melting for 30 minutes (no one thought to ask about drinks just sitting?). We were told they were short staffed as they had one server and one bartender. Weird for  Friday Night @ 10PM. Finally, they brought us a few bottled beers and took our drink order. Our karaoke time was half over by then.Issue 5... ""Poor design and sound proofing"" The place itself has a DJ playing music out in the bar/lounge area for the people not singing karaoke in the rooms. However, the music was sooo loud from the main room that even with the door shut it cut through to what you were singing in the karaoke rooms. Whats the point of singing Bon Jovi or Snoop Dogg or BECK when you just hear DJ announcements and (Thud Thud Thud Thud) over what you are doing.Issue 6... ""Questionable business ethics"" (SEE PICTURE) Not only did Blind Dragon and their staff really disappoint My wedding party and I, but my friend lil S left a 1 star review similar to some of the things I outlined, and then the manager private messaged them back to compensate for the room costs, (which with the delays at first was negligible) ***IF they delete the bad yelp review!!!*** This to me is a huge no no on Yelp. This site is for people to be educated before they make a decision.... and it looks like we got suckered and they pay to play on here. Truly disappointing.The Result: I could not and will not recommend this place to anyone. I also regret taking my wedding party there. I found the employees to be reactive vs working properly. Their drinks and bottle service is way over priced. The place is too dark in the main room, multiple customers including myself had to walk or place our receipts under a light under the bar rail just to see what we owed. They were understaffed. I also found it odd that instead of the managers jumping behind the bar to at least get waters and bring them over to the customers, or help out, they just called people on the phone or on their headset or just told the 2 women dressed in basically lingerie (one bartender and one server) what to do.

"January S.Phoenix, AZ14174388/7/2019Great place for Karaoke! They have private booths for rent. Best of all is that they have free open mic karaoke in the main lounge area every Thursday night from 8pm-close. Great host! Awesome DJ spins between singers. Awesome music selection. It's a really nice room. Excellent sound. The bartenders and servers all wear lingerie which is hot if that's your thing. I have rented booths before with friends on a weekend and that's fun too, but I prefer open mic with an audience. My inner rock star needs his public! Check this place out.

"Rachel S.Gilbert, AZ020471/18/20191 photoCame on a Friday night when they first opened. It was a little quiet crowd wise but the music was great. It picked up around 9pm. Had a lounge vibe with dimmed room and moody paper lanterns in fit with the theme. Theres lot of good photoworthy spots including a Bruce Lee mannequin. Tried the sea salt edamame and chicken lettuce wraps. BOTH were VERY good. Great flavor and mix of veggies with the lettuce wraps. Would recommend as a great pre-game place or a wind down place.

"Suzy M.Scottsdale, AZ0107/22/2019I want to give a big shout out to this place.  I've been going here for about four years.  Mike has bent over backwards to help me with my poor 1991 Honda.  I drove it for twenty five  years and he literally kept it running for me.   Finally in October, I was able to get a new Honda Accord.  I wasn't used to such a long front end and I tapped it on the pole next to my parking space.  I absolutely freaked out.  There was a dent and some plastic hanging out on the wheel well.  I called Mike on a Monday morning and asked if someone could look at it.  Now, mind you, they are not a body shop.  Mike told me to come on in anyway just to see it and possibly refer me to a body shop that could help me.  Jordan went out to the front of my car, looked at it, popped the dent out and was able to cut away the plastic that was hanging down.  All at no charge.  Mike and Jordan, you don't know how much that meant to me.  I'm an elementary school teacher and don't exactly have the best salary.  Thank you for helping me out.  Seriously, these guys are legit.  I hope you can visit them to see for yourselves.

"Alisa L.Las Vegas, NV0201910/30/20201 photoHonest company! Hallelujah! I just got a free, 2nd opinion (technically my 3rd and last) from the owner of Air Done Right, Mark. I was told by the HVAC company who did my fall tune-up that I needed an entire new unit on my roof due to rust in my heater that would cause my heat exchanger to crack and send carbon monoxide through my vents. I had planned to get 3 bids for a new unit, but as you can see from my reviews, the 2nd company (I also got the owner) said my unit was fine. Well, that should have been enough but the 1st company is accusing the 2nd company of giving me incorrect information on my unit and now they claim I'm not stating the facts so I felt the need to really prove them wrong on my terms, not theirs. Let's get a 3rd opinion from another company with 5-star Yelp reviews so people can make an educated decision on their own.As mentioned, Mark came by and I just said I wanted another opinion. I didn't mention anything about rust because I didn't know if I could trust him or not. I also mentioned that I wanted the entire unit looked at, so the AC and heater. He asked if I currently had AC and heat and I told him I did. He was on my roof for a while and then came back down and told me that my circuit board had been replaced within the last few years and that is apparently a common problem with my brand so they keep them on the vans but it's fine, just has some burn marks on the old wires from the former circuit board. I saw a photo and the insulation on the wires is brown on the bottom but not melted. He also said the AC capacitor had been replaced but eveything else looked fine. I specifically asked if there was rust in the heater. He told me that rust was inevitable but it was mild and not a problem. He said I don't need a new unit if someone told me that. Ha! I confessed what had transpired and he said he does lots of follow-ups for a different company who likes to tell people they need new units. Once again, I had another local owner walking away from a big sale and who inspected everything for free. He told me to just make sure to get a spring maintenance and gave me a magnet for my fridge. No pressure to get a maintenance contract, either. I'm not sure they even do that. The 2nd company didn't. Good sign. So, if you are worried you are getting duped, you know who to call for an honest 2nd or 3rd opinion. See my HVAC reviews. Now I have 2 companies to go to for future maintenance and an install in due time and both are smaller, locally-owned operations. Thanks, Air Done Right, for being an honest company in Vegas.Now I won't forget their name!Useful 2FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationKaui T.Business Employee10/31/2020Wow, what an amazing review and we thank you greatly for sharing your experience with all of us!

"Mahreen C.Mississauga, Canada0518/15/20161 photoDO NOT GO TO THIS SALON. Owner is extremely rude and unprofessional. I walked in for the first time today. Asked clearly the price to have shellac removed ONLY and nothing else as I had no time. The girl told me the price and I agreed. She put the acetone and foils to remove the shellac. A few minutes in, the girl tells me she got the price around and its actually double. I said well i asked clearly the price for the service when I walked in and decided to go ahead based on that price. The owner tells me the girl made a mistake, works part time, doesn't know the right price. I said regardless, if you quote a price to the customer then you should honour it. The owner says no problem, you don't like the price, we take it off and you go. I was so shocked. Had she even apologized once or even suggested a compromise, I would have stayed. They took the foils off with my shellac partly removed and did not clean up or anything. Told me I could go if I wasn't happy. I am in total shock! I only walked in there because it's close to my house and I needed a quick removal. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN. With a nail salon on every corner, I'm surprised they are still in business.

"Annie S.Phoenix, AZ289/5/2020So here's the thing. I have worked in the medical field for many years and am familiar with Nationwide Vision. From my experience in the past with them there is a huge difference in the doctors and the store staff. Usually the front is terrible and customer service is non existent, but the doctor is knowlegable and informative. That is NOT the case for this location. The doctor (Dr.Taddonio to be specific) was rude and answered everything with no tact or patient care. My husband went into this location with a possible medical emergency (constant increase in floaters and sudden vision loss in his one eye) and was told to come in later that day. Okay, that's doable (considering they are the ONLY O.D practice open that takes medical cases on the weekend, unfortunately) and glad they took us the same day. There were no problems with the staff and everyone was nice. The doctor though is very short (and I don't mean height) and rude. He diagnoses him with a medical condition and says to go to the retinal specialist. Does not explain to him what it is or how it could of occurred. Along with other comments made throughout the exam that were completely unprofessional and nothing close to knowledgeable. He left the office with a prescription for glasses (smh.. why would the doctor give him an RX before getting his eye looked at?!) and confused on what just happened. I would never recommend this location to anyone with any sense in their head. Because, more then likely you have more sense then this doctor.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationTracy K.Business Owner9/11/2020Hi Annie,We take our customers experience very seriously and we apologize that your recent trip in was not up to our usual level of service.

Oh well.I only left 3 stars because I have to leave something or I cant post.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationJayson H.Business Owner9/22/2020Jim,I would love to chat. This is a Farmers issue that I can't fix. I understand you don't want to chat on the phone however as you read all my reviews say they met me in person. A 3 star review isn't horrible but I would like the ability to earn your business and earn a 5 star review (I hope). I am happy to do a face to face as I never write insurance over email or rarely over the phone. Insurance is never written properly over the phone or email. Discounts are always missing, coverages are always missing. I almost died July 2, 2002 from an 89yr old man running a stop sign. I learned very quickly how insurance is supposed to be written. My settlement check, almost dying was $7,147 which was supposed to cover my injuries forever. I suffer headache 3-6 times a week, so far for 18 years. That $7,147 is a joke. I explain all this in an appt. This is why I don't recommend a phone or email insurance policy. At the end of the day, clients decide what they want after they have been educated. Please, lets do a face to face, or I will ask to update a review. 3 stars hurts our agency.

"P v.Laveen, AZ03515/13/2021We had once gone to Zipps for diner a few years back and had great food and the burger was so good., however we broke our Covid year wih dinner out at Zipps. We were so disappionted with the onion rings and fries. The rings were so hard that they were totally bad and the fries were not anything to applaud about. My wife just got back for lunch with the girls and had gone to Applebees where she again had rings and they were GOOOOD. Even cold as she brought me 2 to enjoy. Onion rings are sommething we don't fry at home and so we try to enjoy them elsewhere.

"Jasmin S.Elite '2021South Mountain Village, Phoenix, AZ4538385/19/2021By far the worst experience with the waitresses & customer attentiveness. My husband & I were seated, our waitress came by & told us about the drinks & left because we wanted a chance to look at the menu. She never came back! She walked past our table several times (5x) no acknowledgment as to if we we were ready to order, after 27mins of waiting we left & went to Native New Yorker. Which was the opposite of what we experienced @ zipps! We were very disappointed with the fact we were ignored multiple times & there's no excuse! She saw us & choose to service her other bigger tables instead. As a former waitress for several years, you should be attentive to everyone because not all big parties tip well-its all about servicing your customers & being attentive to their request!

If anything I was probably only disappointed with my meal as I order my usual bacon cheeseburger with half fries and onion rings. Unfortunately, the fries and onion rings were cold when it hit the table. I was going to send it back, but it would have meant everything as I add the onion rings to my burger... Yeah you like that!!! haha Expectations are not always meet but I usually let them know as the food can be hit or miss. The weekend & happy hour specials are favorable and the Zipparita's tend to be the main reason why I keep returning. Priority to the food should be the next focus as most don't walk away talking stellar about the food.

"Jason M.Gilbert, AZ38122110/23/2019First off, let me be real. I cancelled my last membership because it was just ok, but not great.That said, I tried the highest-tier option Wash Werks had and dude was talking about some ""acryllic coating"" or some such sales-man's pitch, but was like whatever man let's do this.I rolled up, my man handed me an individually-wrapped ""wet-wipe"" for your dash and steering wheel, and another individually wrapped air-freshener square you put under your seat right before your cars about to shine. (Damn, color me impressed at this point.)Ya'll... When my car came out, even the bumpers were shining like the metallic hood and trunk (bumpers aren't metallic anymore and usually aren't as shiny for this reason.) This car wash is like the honey badger. This car wash don't care. This car wash don't give a F*#k!!!! It's about to make everything that goes through it shine and make you proud, like you're taking a pornstar to the prom! When you're done, they have complimentary (free) vacuums and air-hoses to blast away any residual wet spots so your baby is looking glossy and not spotty like Sprint's coverage. In  another unexpected perk, the dressing that went on my rims and tires, made the black shine like it was just elected President. I didn't know black rims and tires could shine like that.I bought my Tesla, brand new, from the factory.  It came out here shining way brighter than the day I picked it up from the factory.This car wash is legit! That acryllic game their talking about isn't idle noise!

It's not many people's dream cars but I'm unlike many people. I brought it to Coulter to be serviced on January 11th and was assisted by Jason Thatcher. Jason was super professional, knowledgeable, and very honest in his approach. He told me my service would take 2 hours, which it did. Thankfully my Caddy got a clean bill of health although he did have some recommendations for me to keep an eye on that I'll probably have Coulter do in the future.It's always nice to be surprised by a dealer's service department.Thanks Jason and thanks Coulter.Useful 2FunnyCool 1Business owner informationCoulter A.Business Customer Service1/19/2021Thank you for your kind words and compliments to Jason and the team!

"John C.Elite '2021Billings, MT386117367489/25/20203 photosI'd say the experience overall was good but could use some improvement. Scheduled an appointment over the phone on a Saturday afternoon for a Monday morning drop-off. Got there about 15 minutes before the scheduled appointment and was checked in within a couple of minutes. Got the shuttle to drop me off at the house (I was told they service a 20 mile radius) and got them to take me back later in the day. My truck was serviced and ready to go within 4 hours. I had the initial 5,000 mile service completed on a Duramax which includes oil and filter, tires, and an inspection. An issue I had with the remote clicker not being able to remote start the engine was an issue I had and got diagnosed as a low voltage reading on the battery: it was replaced at no charge. My feedback: one of the shuttle drivers could not locate my house even with the correct address and was very frustrated on the phone; the check-in was very mechanical and the service tech did not introduce himself, which would have been nice; I called from one number but asked to have all communication sent to another number and that request was not met. But in the grand scheme of things the overall experience was far better than I have had at most dealerships.Useful 1Funny 1Cool 1Business owner informationCoulter A.Business Customer Service9/28/2020Thank you for your kind words!

"Whitney S.Las Vegas, NV9224113/30/20173 photosDecided to try the new neighborhood coffee shop today at the suggestion of a friend. First off, I will say this place is very cute. It is a good spot to meet up with a friend or just sit and work on your laptop; very quiet. It is immaculately clean.  There are plenty of places to sit inside and there was a sign inside suggesting the addition of patio seating soon, which will be nice. I ordered the cafe latte with macadamia nut flavor added. I am not exactly a coffee connoisseur but am an avid coffee drinker with plenty of experience trying different roasts and blends. I thought the coffee was just ok. I think it would have been better if a stronger brew was used for this type of drink; I tasted more of the flavoring and the milk. In addition to the drinks offered, there was a nice assortment of gelato (upwards of 10 flavors) and numerous desserts. All of the desserts are homemade per staff. The desserts looked very good but I would just suggest a different presentation instead of having them covered in saran wrap. I could tell that the cakes were iced beautifully but the saran wrap mushed it down and made it unattractive. I think I will give their coffee another shot, but will just try a regular cup of jo before completely passing judgement.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationEdward R.Business Owner3/31/2017Thank you so for your kind words.

"Kevin L.Reno, NV35125318557/2/2017That was not a croissant. It's advertised as one, sold as one, but no: it was a dense loaf of bread shaped to look like a croissant, glazed on top with some unidentifiable sweetness. A solid disappointment if there ever was one in the croissant department. Do some folks not know what these are? They are the best-know gem in the world of morning pastries. Croissants are light, buttery, flakey, and golden; the opposite of which this was is heavy, dry, spongy, and monochromatic. This was sacrilege. Coffee?  Coffee is served in a gas-station inspired paper cup, even if you're staying for a spell. The taste was similar. Not bad, but not memorable. How about atmosphere, you ask? Cupz is clean. Big windows. Kind of goes for the Modern Blah motif. Free wi-fi. The killer, though, what chases a seated customer out the door: a display case cooler rattling out of control. Isn't this place new? Why the faulty equipment? An endless annoyance turning off, then on, then off, then ON again. SHUT UP. JUST SHUT UP. So why the generous three stars? Two reasons:-- they offer fresh-fruit smoothies, which is a rarity in this town. I just hope they are good. Bonus just for offering. -- a super-sweet young woman serving by herself. She was cheerful, helpful, patient, and just an easy-going delight. The latter was even more notable because I soon overheard the owner/manager some others have griped about in their reviews. I'm the only customer in there so I can't imagine how anything could be stressful at the moment, but he's swearing and giving gruff directions to this cool chick like some dude wrestling with his inner machismo. How she remains upbeat with him as her only company, I dunno. So far as I can tell, she's the best thing going for Cupz, so maybe chill out, stressball. I'd stop in if I needed a coffee or smoothie on my way to/from Blue or RedRock, but not worth going out of one's way for.Useful 5Funny 4Cool 3Business owner informationEdward R.Business Owner7/2/2017Thank you so much for your patronage.

"Ashley P.Elite '2021Honolulu, HI4292035765/16/2017After a long night and day of endless studying, I thought I'd finally make a stop at this place. Once I walked in, I got nothing but a blank stare from the barista while I finished my conversation on the phone and looked at the menu simultaneously. I ordered the iced cold brew and I think it's right for workers to mention when they add charges to the original price if they ask if I want additional flavors...agree? Anyway, the drink turned out perfect.

"Julia M.Elite '2021Charlotte, NC343116586212/11/2011Updated review1 photoThis place is so inconsistent... some visits have been really good and others not so good. I really do wish these guys would up their game!   Yesterday's visit rated only 2 stars because there were issues with both the service we received and with the food.  For starters, it was a bit busier than normal because of the Groupon special.  When we arrived, we were told the wait would be 15-20 mins, but it turned out to be 30+ mins.   However, we decided to wait, because by the time we got in the car to drive somewhere else, we would have burned that much time anyway.So, when we were finally seated, the waitress came by pretty quickly to serve us coffee and take our order.  She left the carafe on the table, which is nice, but sadly, she did not check on how much coffee was in it, because when we were ready for a refill, the carafe was empty. That wouldn't be so bad, except for the fact that our server disappeared and did not come back to check on us.   In fact, our food was brought to the table by someone else and then she finally reappeared.  It took her a while to fill the carafe and return it to the table.  Now, for the food... it was a disappointment all the way around.  David ordered an omelette, which was cold and pretty flavorless. Plus, he said it was a litte runny from being undercooked. I ordered one of the specials - gingerbread pancakes w/side of scrambled eggs and chicken sausage. The eggs were cold. The gingerbread pancakes were cold and did not taste at all like gingerbread.  They simply tasted like whole wheat pancakes.  In fact, I asked our server if they had brought the correct plate because not only did the pancakes not taste like gingerbread, they were missing the side of cranberry compote.  Which she said they had run out of (it would have been nice to know that upfront).I'll give them one more chance, but if its not a good experience, I may just stick to Le Peep instead.Useful 3FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationNoreen E.Business Owner1/7/2012Julie, thank you for your feedback on Skillets.

It was very good - definitely rich and creamy.  The potatoes were not exactly what I was expecting but they were good. Instead of traditional home fries or hash browns, these potatoes were shredded and baked in creamy/cheesy casserole style. In addition to potatoes, it also included a small cup of fruit and your choice of toast.  It is a lot  of food so take your appetite with your (or do like I did and take half of it home for later!)  My friend got the cranberry pecan belgian waffle and it looked outstanding! Again, I was pleased with the quality of the food and the service was fine on this visit as well.Read more5/28/2011Previous reviewJust went back for my second visit - I would say this place really rates 3.5 stars but not quite a 4.    The first visit was during the week  at lunch time and today's visit was Saturday at around 10:50.  On both visits, our wait time was under 10 minutes.  (However, we once tried to go once on a Sunday and the line was out the door so we didn't even try to get in.) The place is open, sunny and cheery with a sort of country-kitchen  decor. The service has been so-so on both of my visits, but not terrible.  But no matter, the food  was good.  Today I had blueberry-banana whole wheat pancakes with scrambled eggs. The dish also comes with 2 pieces of thick-cut smokehouse bacon.  However since I don't eat pork, I asked for the chicken apple sausage in lieu of the bacon.  The pancakes had good flavor and texture. (The syrup was decent, but they really should serve pure maple without charging extra for it.)  The scrambled eggs were tasty with a nice texture and the sausage had nice flavor and textrure as well. David ordered the potato pancakes with scrambled egg whites and pork sausage.  He thought the potato-pancakes were pretty good but he prefers applesauce rather than the diced apples (just a personal preference on his part).   The coffee is decent - not the best in the world, and not the worst.  We do like the fact that they bring a carafe to your table so you don't have to wait for refills. (This is a big deal for me & David - we need our coffee!) The only thing that almost ruined today's experience for me was the fact that after our orders were put in, our server came over and told me that there would be a charge for substituting the chicken sausage for the bacon.  I said that was fine.  But he didn't explain what he really meant is that I would be charged for the plate (including the bacon) plus charged for a side order of chicken sausage (despite the fact that I did not get  bacon - If I had known that, I would have just kept the bacon on my plate - to give to David - and ordered a side of Chicken Sausage).  Now, don't get me wrong,  I have no problem paying an ""upcharge"" when the item I want to substitute costs MORE than the item that comes on the plate... but when the item I wanted costs LESS than the item that I asking to leave off, I think it is silly for the restaurant to charge more.  (Plus, it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth and makes me think twice about whether I want to go back or not.) In the case of the bacon here- (which I did NOT want ) - a side order costs $3.95 while a side of the chicken sausage costs $3.50.  We did complain at the checkout and said that we were willing to pay a ""upcharge""  but we did not think it was fair to simply be charged for a side order of chicken sausage when we didn't also get the bacon.  So, the hostess/manager quickly took care of it  and took the extra charge off our bill. I thanked her for taking care of it, but I have to say the restaurant needs to rethink their policy because a lot of people may have just walked away angry.

"John H.Elite '2021Charlotte, NC361160414125/16/2011Capital Y-U-M!  This place is great for breakfast/brunch.  Haven't tried their lunch yet, but they are only open during the day for these meals specifically.  My first trip we lucked out and didn't have much of a wait but if you time it incorrectly it seems to be a popular spot.  If you do have a wait, there are some inviting benches in the entrance and the turn-over seems pretty quick.I tried their corned beef hash, eggs, and hash browns.  Really was blown away with their buttery hash browns - I guess I had become complacent with having generic (sometimes burnt too much) hash browns at certain other breakfast places that stay open 24hrs and will not be named.  The servings are very generous and definitely has their own unique ""skillet's"" spin on it.The dining room is cozy and we actually got into a conversation with the table next to us.  Apparently the word on the street is that skillets is family owned and the owner's husband is very crafty with wood.  He created all the benches and furniture in the place which adds a nice touch and feel in ambiance points.  The room actually made me feel like I was eating a home cooked meal up in the mountains with all the wood work and the rooster paraphernalia around.I don't find myself on this end of town very much, but if I do - this is definitely the ""go-to"" breakfast place.Useful 3FunnyCool 1Business owner informationNoreen E.Business Owner1/10/2012So glad you classify us as Y-U-M John.

"Bryan P.Marietta, GA056/3/2011We visited on a recent Sunday morning and the good news is our wait to get a table was not that bad - maybe 20 minutes. But that's where the good news ends.Once inside, maybe another 5-10 minutes before our server stopped by. Then another 5 minutes or so to get untensils and water. Then, another 40 minutes for our food to arrive!! During this time, no communication from the server, no smiling faces or apology from anyone on the staff. When our food finally arrived it was stone cold! If we hadn't waited so long, we would have sent the food back; but at this rate we would have been there all day.  After mentioning the problem to our server, he did the right thing and gave us the meal free. Even still, not once did anyone from the front of the house stop by to say one thing. Passed by our table often to frantically bus or set tables nearby, but couldn't be bothered to acknowledge the issue. Even when we left, no ""thank you"" or ""come again"" from the hostess. Basically they really could not have cared less about us as customers. Bottom line, Skillets has great potential; but until they work on improving some basic restaurant management fundamentals, not sure we'll be visiting again anytime soon.Useful 4Funny 1CoolBusiness owner informationNoreen E.Business Owner1/13/2012Bryan, thank you for dining at Skillets and I agree with you that we had just opened our doors for business only weeks before your visit with us and we did experience growing pains initially.

"Jeff W.Waxhaw, NC131165/13/2020Updated reviewYou were the one that told me I could have the phone repaired on Saturday. It was the reason I chose your business over others. This was not a mistake on my part, this was an error on yours. With that said, the right thing to do would be to return my deposit but you did not. That's being petty if you ask me. For the record, I took my phone to a competitor who had it fixed for me within 1 hr. of walking in to their store. They were also $40 cheaper than you. I hope the $20 deposit you took from me was worth it. You live and learn.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationScott L.Business Owner5/18/2020Jeff, we've been in business a long time now, and we wouldn't be able to say that if we did anything like the shady practices you're describing here. Please understand that whether you're dealing with a phone repair shop, an auto repair shop, or really any kind of business in any kind of industry whatsoever, there's a reason why the popular term used is ""estimate"" rather than ""guarantee."" Every technician gives an estimate for how long they think a repair or job will take, but that estimate is exactly what it sounds like: an honest approximation of the time, parts, labor, and costs involved. Once the phone is opened up -- just like a car, an air conditioner, a computer, or whatever -- there's always a possibility that the expert will learn more about the problem at hand, and this new information can alter the original timing of the estimate. While we can understand how that'd be frustrating from a consumer's standpoint, it's also the reality of practically every industry and business on earth.

"Guy M D.Waxhaw, NC0516/19/2020Here is the whole story, you decide: When I called they told me they would charge me $35 to open and clean it out and let it air out overnight after using some alcohol to help dry it out. I let them know I need the phone for work in the morning and 10am is too late. She said not problem, come in and we will take care of it immediately and have it done by closing. So I head over and drop off my phone. I ran some errands and headed back over at 5:20. I walked in and I asked if the phone was ready and she said yes but.....When we removed your screen the water shifted and fried the screen because it went out while he was working on it (so sounds like he left it on while he was working on it). So we changed your screen for you (without asking me) since you said you use it for work. Also the Face ID still doesn't work.They were really nice about it and instead of charging me $35 plus $150 for the screen they charged me $90 total. I told her I appreciate the consideration to fix it for me so I can use it for work but I wouldn't have given them permission to fix it as I could just go buy a new phone since that's half of what I owe on the phone. I then noticed that the back camera had condensation in it still. I told her they just need to pick up the camera and wipe under it. The woman said it's all one piece so I need a new camera but they don't have any in stock. It's another $85 for that. I said I'm pretty sure it's 2 pieces but she told me it was indeed one. I told her had I known all of this I definitely wouldn't had fixed it since that's the same amount I owe on the phone and could just buy a new one since I would at least have a warranty on the work. I walked out and as I went to place a call. I noticed green muck around the front camera and a fuzz on it. I went back and after 5 minutes of them looking at it they thought it was a glare. When I pushed harder they offered to look at it closer and see if they could do anything about it. I told them no, I'd just come back another day (they seemed reluctant when they offered since it wasn't a big deal to them since it still took pictures. Also since they told me I needed a new camera anyhow and it was about 15 minutes before closing). I went back the next day and told them I was able to use my phone for work and they could keep it the rest of the day to dry and get the water they missed and finish cleaning both cameras. The woman said they would be happy to do it for $35. I told her the only reason I left was because she told me nothing could be done about the back camera and I needed a new one. Now that I know that was wrong I came back to fix it to insure no missed water could hurt my phone since they won't warranty their work due to water damage. She told me they offered to do that last night and I said no. I explained I said no because of the whole one piece camera thing. She argued that I or she must have misunderstood the question and answer (I literally pointed at the camera as I asked the question). She also said since I insisted that I needed the phone for work in the morning they couldn't keep it overnight which didn't allow for enough drying time. I explained had I known she was wrong about the once piece camera comments I would had them open the phone and dry it again before leaving or would had figured out a way to start work later in the day.She said it's his time we have to pay for and we offered to help last night. I said well I'm not paying you $35 again when all I did was go home and go to bed. It's not like I dunked it in water again. You guys missed water and when I asked about it I was told you didn't and it was a camera issue. So now I'm back because of the workmanship. She didn't budge so I walked out. Even if there was a misunderstanding and she is right about trying to explain the parts of the camera, who lets a phone go out the door with water still in the case? Or at least say, hey it's still wet, I know you need the phone but you really need to let it air dry. They are the professionals here not me.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationScott L.Business Owner6/26/2020Thank you for your extensive review, Guy.

"Carli L.North Royalton, OH5149157/5/20161 photoI dropped off a pair of heels for repair and a pair of UGG boots to be cleaned. I was told they would call me and let me know when it was finished as the repair might take some time. After two weeks I called them to follow up, as I had not heard anything, and was told that both pairs of shoes were done. When I went to pick them up, I was told the UGG boots actually were not done and I would have to come back. When I did come back to pick up a week later, they were not the right color at all. All of the color completely taken out during the cleaning process. If this is something that normally happens, they should warn customers, as I never would have done it. But I suspect this is not normal. I told the person who was working there and I was unhappy with the boots were no longer the right color, and he said the color came out that's all. Then the card machine was down so l had to pay cash for my ruined boots.

"Alec C.Tempe, AZ129119/25/2017First to ReviewI was the first person to live in this complex June 2016. They appear luxurious from the outside but don't be deceived, they are very cheaply built with shoddy construction. The floorboards were peeling up, our garage motor fell down because they used nails instead of screws not to mention our countertops were not secure. Three doors down a neighbor has already had problems with a termite infestation. They are overpriced for the value you receive. The amenities? Little to none. Only a small pool without a Jacuzzi. The location is in great proximity to campus for ASU students but the surrounding neighborhoods are not the best. I've had  packages stolen from the front door and multiple items stolen out of the garage. The trash pickup has been an issue from day one. Many times, it is left sitting outside for days and no one picks it up while the homeless scavenge through it. The trash guy claims he's too good to pick up a pizza or amazon box when we pay 30 dollars a month for the trash pickup service. May 2017, NorthStar Property Management took over out of Tucson. Google their reviews for yourself. Since NorthStar took over, no one is ever in the front office. The new leasing manager lacks communication, rarely responding to emails, calls, or texts. It is very frustrating when you are trying to get things accomplished. I do not recommend living here until they make some drastic changes. There are a ton of other town home communities in Tempe that offer better value. Do your research and live elsewhere.Useful 5Funny 1CoolBusiness owner informationNorthStar M.Business Owner9/28/2017Hi Alec, thanks for taking the time to write us a review.We are sorry to hear you had some issues when you first moved in.

If you still have anything needing fixed, please let us know right away. Also we're sorry to hear you were having trouble reaching our manager, the hours that we are available is clearly posted on the front door of the office.

Our property manager also manages another property that is only minutes away, so she can get to the property fairly quickly if needed.If for any reason our manager can't answer the phone, please leave us a voicemail and we'll return your call right away.

"Hayden E.Las Vegas, NV18551/2/2020Ordered a veggie burger, flatbread, wrap, and smoothie. 30 min wait (I understand cooked to order and fresh but come on). After I grabbed my food and left I remembered that they forgot the smoothie also, came back to ask for it, they made it previously and put in a refrigerator for the 30 minutes and it became a bland juice from sitting for so long. Also they ran out of sweet potato fries and to compensate mixed in regular fries without saying anything. Just for 40$ and 30 a minute wait there's better optionsUseful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationCole C.Business Owner1/2/2020Hayden, we apologize for any inconvenience or lack of service.  We are actually in day 2 of a new cook/chef.That should only explain the wait.  But, he was making a delivery as other staff couldn’t drive, and the staff there has been on record, slower then we are comfortable.  I can’t make sense of the smoothie issue, and will address that with them, and hopefully correct immediately.Please find your way back to us this weekend, I plan to be there all day Sunday, and would love to provide you a better experience than you had today.In all honesty, this review helps me make the hard decisions, as the service has been subpar, and will be addressed, as current employees are about to be shown how to appropriately serve guests, or be asked to leave.  You can email me, I would love to chat and offer a solution to your experience.Thank you,MMG ownership.Read more","Business owner informationCole C.Business Owner1/2/2020Hayden, we apologize for any inconvenience or lack of service.  We are actually in day 2 of a new cook/chef.That should only explain the wait.  But, he was making a delivery as other staff couldn’t drive, and the staff there has been on record, slower then we are comfortable.  I can’t make sense of the smoothie issue, and will address that with them, and hopefully correct immediately.Please find your way back to us this weekend, I plan to be there all day Sunday, and would love to provide you a better experience than you had today.In all honesty, this review helps me make the hard decisions, as the service has been subpar, and will be addressed, as current employees are about to be shown how to appropriately serve guests, or be asked to leave.  You can email me, I would love to chat and offer a solution to your experience.Thank you,MMG ownership.Read more"
"Keith C.Los Angeles, CA6963210/23/2019This was my second bad experience with customer service at this location, and I will no longer be giving my business to this location. First issue was resolved after arguing back and forth with the employees about the rewards system not working properly, then the owner resolved and I placed several 10 meal plan orders with no problem, and several one off meals that were always good. This is not a random bashing, or just trying to start stuff. Especially when I have no complaints about the food, which I think is good. But I cannot continue to give my money to a company that has such absolutely horrific customer service. Today's incident was the last straw.-I placed a 10 meal plan order to be ready at 11:10am.-I didn't arrive until 1:55pm, 2 hours and 45mins after the food would be ready. (This is not relevant)-When I arrived, my food was sitting on the counter. - I was on my phone, didn't realize the length of time at that moment how long it would of been sitting there.-halfway home (5mins) it dawns on me chicken/steak can't be out after 2 hours, along with a warm salads now. I call back and ask for a manager. The exact response is ""uhmmmmmmmm okayyyy????"" As if what I am asking for is an absurd request. This is always the type of customer service I receive via the employees. Rude, flat, condescending tones on the vast majority of visits. The owner was literally the only one who was a cool dude and I would talk with a bit when visiting.-Justin comes on the phone, I know his name because I specifically asked. I verbatim said ""I placed this order, it's been sitting out for almost 3 hours, I need the food replaced I will have my gf come back and drop it off. She is going to go the gym, and will pick up the new order at 4pm so the new order is fresh. He verbatim said okay will be ready at 4pm. I once AGAIN said okay great so she will leave the gym and see you at 4pm. He said okay sounds good or something similar to that effect. My girlfriend arrives, and the lady with glasses immediately tells her she can't take the food back and she called the owner because the food has left the restaurant so they can't take it back. They call me, put me on speaker. Justin says ""I never said I would take the food back"". This is verbatim what he said. I respond ""you're saying I am lying about you would take the food back? Wtf would I send my gf down here with the food then?"" I literally was floored. I would rather have someone curse me out than to call me a liar. That's just the cloth I'm cut from and my morals personally.Justin: You said you would drop the food off, not that we would give you new replacement food.Me: Why would I drop off food I already paid for, and not get replacement food?Justin: I just said yes you can drop the food offMe: Why...would I drop off...food...that I paid for...and not get replacement food?Justin: repeats same thing.Me: This would make no sense. If anything, I would keep the food I paid for, not send my gf back to drop it off. Also, you said the new food would be ready specifically at 4pm when my gf was done with the gym. That literally implies/is understood, that NEW food is being picked up at 4pm. This isn't a concept or situation that would or could be misinterpreted.At this point, everyone started yelling at my girlfriend, the lady continuously was talking over me when I was on speaker and my girlfriend asked her to let me speak and stop talking over me. She continued to talk over me when I was talking. But for them to take something so basic and simple, as them not refrigerating chicken/steak/salad, after being left out on the counter for 2hours and 45mins, not willing to replace it, then literally telling me on the phone via Justin yes we will replace it, CONFIRMING the 4pm pickup time for the new food (this is how it's impossible for confusion: if he thought I was just ""dropping off the old food"" which in itself makes 0 logical sense when I already paid for it, why would he agree SPECIFICALLY to a 4pm pickup time of the new food? That literally means he is replacing the old food with new food that would be ready for pickup at 4pm.)   It's so insulting and rude you're literally calling me a liar. I talked to you 10 mins ago. Do you think I would randomly send my girlfriend down there if this wasn't already discussed? Do you think I'm trying to scam some new hot meals? What would my motive be? Why in the world would I do that? I literally already paid for my food, there is no ""angle"" possible. This is what is seriously flabbergasting.  Why have these issues NEVER happened with the 3 other meal prep companies I use? I value my time over money. I would rather pay more for a service and receive good service, than to save a few bucks and receive terrible customer service. But to literally do this to a customer, who has a verifiable track record of several meal plan orders, and random single orders over the course of a year, is just terrible.Useful 1Funny 2CoolBusiness owner informationCole C.Business Owner10/24/2019You may feel it is “not relevant” but that’s a huge point in your frustration.You ordered at 10:10 to pick up at 11:10.We don’t open until 10:30, which means everything we made for you was fresh and ready in a short period of time after you placed the online order.Quick note, cooked food can stay out in a controlled environment, and when prepared hot, should not be put into a fridge until after it has had a chance to cool to acceptable temps for prevention of bacateria build up in a hot to immediate cold environment.Keith, I’ve met you several times, and you have been a customer for a few meal plan orders as well as several take out orders.  There has never been an issue, you’ve made me aware of, in the past.We take the time to make your order and have it ready, fresh for when you ask.  11:10.  It was ready at 11:10am.  I know as I helped make it, before leaving at 11am for a catering delivery.  I am sorry the interaction with my cook, Justin, was misinformed or misleading or incorrect.  And his commitment to you shouldn’t have given the impression we could take the food back.  I do wish you would have reached me directly for a resolution and explanation before committing this amount of time to social media, with incorrect and false claims about us as a company.The manager, with glasses, is an owner, and was told to shut up by you girlfriend, when explaining the situation.  That’s not a way to resolve a situation.  Nor should there be an expectation that you can order fresh cooked food, and we would Immediately refrigerate it.  You came later than you initially claimed when you placed your order, and are now frustrated and complaining it needed to be remade without cost, where we don’t have refrigeration to store everyone’s meals that get ordered.

And I am the type to complain and never go back.  I was amazed to see one poor review...it is an anomaly.  She is great.  You will be very pleased.In fact, we have a 4 year old (since 2.5 yrs) who we take to her instead of a local cheap cuts or kids cut place where he had 2 hack jobs. Our boy's hair looks great.  People actually take the time to compliment his haircut. She has patience and understanding that is needed for child.... and discerning adults.  (I am sure she would rather being doing cuts and colors that create more revenue instead).  I don't review a lot of businesses so know that this is one you can count on.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationAmanda W.Business Owner3/23/2020This is such a thoughtful review!

"Samson S.Los Angeles, CA857/9/2019This is in the running for the most bizarre customer service experience of my life.   Came in as a new customer for a men's haircut with Leah, let me preface-- she is a talented hairstylist, the review is NOT about quality of cut, the 1 star review reflects the abysmal customer service and manners shown by the owner (mainly) and the hairstylist (secondly). My haircut was booked as a $45 dollar men's haircut, supposed to take in ballpark of 40-45 minutes.   Leah, was wanting to communicate constantly including asking me how I felt about the cut every 5 minutes along the way, assumingly she wanted to do a great job so I would return and possibly even tell more people about the business makes sense right? ... She spent about 1 hour and 15 minutes on the cut (WHICH I HAD NO IDEA OF UNTIL WE FINISHED) I had no problem as I had no more commitments that day, I paid, left her a tip, we shake hands all is good... or so I thought.    When I returned for a follow up cut the next month, I literally get pulled aside by the hairstylist Leah who was bent out of shape and disturbed with me that she spent 1 hour 15 minutes on my haircut and didn't charge more money.. (BUT SAID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT IT BEING AN ISSUE DURING MY INITIAL HAIRCUT), so while I am trying to respond to Leah and tell her how I perceived what happened the OWNER of the salon, literally came over and sat down in the chair in front of me with a wide eyed, crazy scathing look on her face to further interrogate me and issue stern warning that Leah could only spend 45 minutes on my cut or the price would go up to $65.... Let me reiterate, I did nothing other than initially book a regular men's haircut with this place and the hairstylist went over without saying a word about it while it was happening or immediately after and I didn't realize we went over... maybe the stylist should keep eyes on the time and communicate with me that we have to stop??  How at all is that my fault??  HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED anything remotely like this and have gotten my haircut for 25 years...  Oh, and during the owner's rant at me.. she exclaimed  ""LEAH IS THE BEST HAIRSTYLIST IN THE CITY!!! I CALLED HER FOR 5 MONTHS TO COME WORK FOR ME!!"" Ummm what does this have to do with my haircut running over time??  Completely Bizarre, unprofessional, rude, and undeserving of my hard earned money even with the decent haircut, I would have rather gone to fantastic Sam's and saved my self the trouble of dealing with such lunacy.  Good riddance to this place.Useful 1Funny 1Cool 2Business owner informationAmanda W.Business Owner7/16/2019Thank you for coming in, Samson.

"Jason D.Las Vegas, NV813554/9/2016This gym is disgusting. I've never seen a single cleaner here and it really shows. Yes there's hard  after in Las Vegas but their water fountain is absolutely disgusting and it shows. Their urinal is closed in the men's room and the smell of shit is seeping out into the main fitness area. They do have a full lifting rack which is great but this is a small overpriced gym for lifters. There's roughly 6 treadmills 4 elliptical 3 stair steppers which is cool and the Dumbbells go up high enough to fit anyone's needs (200 lbs) but I'm sorry I cannot go back this place is utterly disgusting. My girlfriend when she goes without me gets lots of inappropriate looks. I cannot recommend this gym to anyone.

We arrived at about 12:45 and were given the choice between indoor or covered balcony seating with heaters by every table. We picked the balcony, and the hostess had no problem when we asked to sit at a table farther from other parties. We were given cornbread and honey butter and I ordered the she crab soup to start. Delicious! The short rib sandwich special that the waiter described sounded too good to pass up, and it was! I felt like the entire sandwich melted in my mouth.

Creepy?  What did I walk into?What I walked into was a well oiled machine for reservations, getting people seated, and getting greeted by name (ingenious!). I didn't have a reservation and just wanted to sit at the bar.  She called up my name and the number of my barstool and away I went in the elevator, ""top floor please"".  Only one table per elevator ride, yeah, I rode COVID free, alone!  I get up to the roof and I'm greeted immediately, by name, and shown to my seat.   Okay, not creepy, fancy!  I wanted a local brew and decided on an espresso porter, hello!  It was sooooo good!  Now onto food. I'm not terribly hungry, although I wish I was!  One page menu,  you know it's legit!Venison or black and blue?  Well they ran out of venison (seasonal menus, which I love!  Means they make what's fresh and what they have, NOT the frozen crap you see with places with 100 page menus!). So the choice is made black and blue....Holy shnikes, legit foodgasm!  I'm gonna be real for just a minute and say, the explosions of flavor in my mouth were not normal.

"Michael W.Elite '2021Winterset, IA110163644/24/20211 photo1 check-in5 star without question. Building, atmosphere, wait staff and food. It was a complete package. We started with some appetizers. The stand out was the fried Okra. Most of our party was not very familiar with okra, but were a huge fan after eating the appetizer. I ordered the Tuna and a side order of the grits. Absolutely amazing food. The tuna was cooked perfectly over a bed of grits and a slaw. It gave you 2 very distinct flavors and worked separately as well as in one glorious bite. We also shared some of the deserts. Specifically a chocolate brownie type cake and the crepe brûlée. Both were exceptional. I am hoping that I have an excuse to come back!What a view.Useful 1FunnyCool 1Business owner informationChristopher J.Business Manager4/24/2021Michael, Thank you for the great five-star review!  We certainly hope that you find an excuse to make it back!  We would love to have you visit again.Read more","Business owner informationChristopher J.Business Manager4/24/2021Michael, Thank you for the great five-star review!  We certainly hope that you find an excuse to make it back!  We would love to have you visit again.Read more"

"Stephanie T.Pittsburgh, PA104671810/29/2010I went here for dinner with a couple friends about a month ago. Seeing as Italian is one of my absolute favorite cuisines, I have a slight bias towards Italian restaurants.I ordered the Ravioli of the Day, which consisted of Sweet Potato and Goat Cheese Ravioli in a light butter sauce topped with walnuts. (Sounds absolutely divine, right?) Upon first bite, I thought the dish was DELICIOUS. After the third, I was completely and utterly sick of it. In hindsight, I realize the sweet potato was TOO sweet and totally overpowered the sourness of the goat cheese and richness of the butter sauce. The walnut topping definitely helped balance out the sweetness, but it was still too much. I could barely get through 5 bites before my taste buds conceded defeat.My companion diners seemed to enjoy their dishes, but perhaps it was due to their ordering simpler menu items (gnocchi with alfredo sauce) or choosing dishes that are typically on their menu every day. I'm guessing it might be the latter, since sweet potato seems to be more of an autumnal menu item.Aside from the food, the ambiance was pleasant and ""romantic"" and the service was decent (nothing atrocious, but also nothing to write home about). Perhaps I just need to give them a second try, but seeing as there are hundreds of other dining options in Pittsburgh, I highly doubt they'll be given that chance anytime soon.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationSusan P.Business Owner2/8/2012Hi and I want to thank you for commenting.

"Caroline S.Scottsdale, AZ801293479/9/20207 photosOne good thing about this location is that they have two parking spaces available for patrons. It is incredibly expensive for what we got but I think that's the typical price in downtown Phoenix. I ordered a decaf espresso over ice because they didn't have decaf coffee. My daughter ordered a chai iced tea and my husband ordered a regular coffee. We also ordered an avocado toast, and avocado toast with bacon and egg, and a breakfast burrito. I would have given them another star, but I think they're about 20-25% too expensive. But I'm old and still can't get over the cost of tuition.

"Mark H.Toronto, Canada695107/11/2013I signed up for a Yelp account just to warn people about this place. I walked into Taste of Mediterranean today for lunch and saw the man behind the counter drop tongs on the floor, pick them up and place them on the counter. No washing, no wiping, no big deal.This seems suspicious, but I thought ""okay, maybe he's going to wash them later... he just wants to do my order first - obviously not using the floor-tongs.""I ordered the quarter chicken, rice, potatoes special as advertised in the window. He picked up the tongs that were JUST on the floor and used them to pick up the piece of chicken from the warming tray. That is disgusting and unsafe. I can't help but wonder what safety standards he ignores when a customer isn't standing right in front of him. I strongly suggest everyone to avoid this restaurant.UsefulFunny 1Cool 1Business owner informationTaste Of M.Business Owner4/3/2014First of all thanks for the feedback and comment.

My parents took money out of their retirement so we could get ""the best"" there was and we were sadly mistaken.Because my X was ""unemployed"" it was impossible to receive child support.

"Binish M.Grier Heights, Charlotte, NC016/9/2020I made a mistake to reach out to this company for a home inspection.  From the time we contacted this company, Joe was unprofessional and rude. We still went ahead with the company thinking to give them a chance to prove us wrong. We were told home inspection agreement will come via email soon after the appointment was confirmed but we didn't receive an email until 2 HOURS before the scheduled appointment! We were then asked to sign the agreement in a rush.  When we asked to reschedule the appointment in order to read over the agreement, we were simply told, ""Find someone else."" Very unprofessional, rude and childish behavior!!Useful 2FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationJoe F.Business Owner6/10/2020The complainer is the wife of the person I dealt with. She doesn't have all the facts. If I was rude with her husband from the time he contacted me why did he want me to do his inspection and why write a nasty review when I didn't???? He received a docusign contract at least TWELVE hours in advance of the inspection, the evening before the inspection, which had been planned about a week in advance. Honestly, I should have sent him the contract well in advance and that was an oversight on my part because I was so busy. When I realized I had forgotten to send him the contact, I contacted him and informed him of the oversight and told him to look for it in his email. I sent him a text the night before asking him to check his email and sign the contract. He could have signed it on his phone in 5 minutes! The morning of the inspection he informed me by text at 5:30 a.m. that he needed to postpone (because he didn't have time to read a one page contract). (A cancellation at the last minute is very rude to a business owner. I had to sit home that half a day and earned no income. Quite frankly I don't want to work for the type of person who wants to postpone at the last minute and thinks that's OK.) I told him my calendar was full for the next week and I could not postpone and he would have to find somebody else. (The beautiful thing about America is that he can hire whomever he wants, and, I don't have to work for people who treat me badly.) The bottom line is HE NEVER SIGNED THE CONTRACT and that is why he didn't get the inspection that he wanted.

"Stacie A.Fourth Ward, Charlotte, NC1871156/9/2020Joe from Alpha and Omega home inspectors was absolutely fantastic! He reviewed two properties for me and was extremely thorough. He explained things so that I could clearly understand the issues that needed to be fixed, provided an extremely detailed report and was extremely pleasant to work with. This was my first time buying a home and after the first home inspection, due to the issues identified by Joe, I declined to continue with the purchase of the home (which I am extremely thankful for as there were a lot of major concerns). He then inspected the home that am about to close on and made me feel so comfortable and confident going into this purchase. Joe is friendly, very detailed and has the home buyers best interest at heart. I highly recommend Joe for your home inspection needs!

"Paige J.Elite '2021Sacramento, CA5473268356/3/2016First to ReviewJoe is incredibly thorough and by the book. He might even be more OCD than me, which is saying a lot. He was great about communication via text/email beforehand, and kept me updated day of when he was late. His inspections will most likely take longer than other companies because he's very diligent. He's a dream inspector for a buyer, but probably a terror for the seller because he will find everything. His report is awesome because he records the process and later dictates it to the report so you get all the details. He uses laymen terms, which I appreciated. And with that he'd explain what is acceptable vs what isn't so you know what you're looking for or what you'll need to do to fix things. Price wise he's spot on or even slightly less than the competition, so no worries there. Definitely recommend him for your home inspection, but he does stay booked so get him early!Useful 6Funny 1Cool 1Business owner informationJoe F.Business Owner10/6/2016Thank you for taking the time to write this review!

"Hasil P.Charlotte, NC081/6/2018The inspection report states that there is a furnace powering the heat in the house and that the heat in the house is powered by natural gas.Six months after purchasing our home, we need the heater working and it isn't.  Three separate heating and air companies have come by to look at our system, and by all accounts (except Alpha & Omega's) our heat is running exclusively on electrical heat strips (no natural gas, no furnace).  Our energy bills are through the roof to run these heat strips and every heating and air professional has indicated that running electrical heat strips is a completely ineffective and inefficient way to heat a home.While Alpha & Omega inspection pointed out some useful superficial changes we should ask the seller to make--now that we own the home, we would much prefer he had knowledge of and pointed out the substantial issues with the home (like ""There is no way that this heating system will keep this home warm in the winter."").  I believe that this is information an inspector should be able to determine without calling in a specialized HVAC inspector.  Hugely disappointed with the lack of relevant information provided in the inspection report.Useful 3FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationJoe F.Business Owner1/10/2018The inspection was performed on a 50 year old house with a 20 year old HVAC system in May of 2017 and had so much wrong that the inspection resulted in a 39 page report. The inspection lasted from 9:30 am. to 2:30 p.m. The HVAC defects outlined below are NOT ""superficial"" and the buyer didn't address them until the current cold snap arrived. Likely, he didn't do anything else I recommended in the report.I had this statement in the report: ""The home contains and abandoned furnace in a bathroom closet and and abandoned duct work in the crawlspace. The ducts contribute to restricted ventilation and restricts access to the crawlspace. The furnace and ducts are essentially trash that should be removed like any trash and especially to increase access to the crawlspace.""I also said: ""One or more furnace(s) is at the end of its design life and you should budget for a new system. It could last a few years or fail tomorrow. It should be more closely monitored, serviced bi-annually, and have its filters changed frequently. It would also be wise to keep a home warranty policy current. You should consider having it thoroughly evaluated by a licensed HVAC contractor prior to the close of escrow."" And, ""One or more AC condenser(s) outside is estimated to be very old and is at or beyond its anticipated design life. You should budget for a new system immediately. It may last a year or more, but could easily fail tomorrow. You should consider having it thoroughly evaluated by a licensed HVAC contractor prior to the close of escrow because the cost of replacement could affect your valuation of the property.""I also said: ""No central heat or AC was provided for the rear right bedroom, and the family room considered a 'habitable room'. All habitable rooms are required to be provided with a direct source of heat according to commonly accepted building standards. Service by a licensed HVAC contractor is recommended.""And: ""We were unable to find the return air compartment filters. We therefore recommend an evaluation by a licensed HVAC contractor who should confirm its location and ensure it is in acceptable condition.""I described he HVAC installation as ""UNPROFESSIONAL"". Yes, in bold and all caps.Finally, the report stated: "" Therefore...it is essential that any recommendations that we make for service or a second opinion be scheduled before the close of escrow, because a specialist could reveal additional defects or recommend further upgrades that could affect your evaluation of the property...... [if] the current owner cannot demonstrate its service within the previous year should be evaluated by a HVAC contractor prior to close of escrow, particularly if the unit is nearing the end of its expected life span.""Did he do any of the things I recommended? Nope! In summary, the report is filled with statements urging him to have it evaluated and serviced prior buying the home. He was also warned that the house was sold by a flipper, that it had numerous modifications, that it had failed city inspections, and that we could not endorse the modifications performed in this house. The house had problems galore with the crawl space, attic, electrical, roof, standing water in the crawl space, animal feces in the crawl space, parts of the crawlspace that were inaccessible, and on and on. Basically the house was an example of someone trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear and charge a premium for it due to its location. Any reasonable person would have called his inspector to discuss the report. Most reasonable people would have run as fast as they can away from this house. He didn't call to discuss anything and now wants to blame me for his buyer's remorse due to his electricity bills when it's 10 degrees F.I have 170 reviews on Angie's List to date. 162 of them are A ratings. I perform about 400 inspections a year and have for 15 years. This client's satisfaction is disappointing, but an anomaly. You can't make everyone happy, sadly.

"Steve W.Calgary, Canada81886537/15/20188 photosWe had a great dinner here. I haven't been to one of the Cactus Club Cafe establishments in many years. The food was well prepared and well presented. I found our server to be right on the ball with bring dishes, checking in and taking away empty plates. We tried the Tuna Stack which just seemed to be advertised everywhere including the bathroom in there. It was delicious with the avocado. The other appetizer we tried were their salt and pepper wings. For entrees we had the salmon, tuna poke bowl and the angus steak. All were perfect. Usually you expect the salmon to be slightly over done, but that was not the case. The desserts were awesome too especially the cheesecake. The prices were getting up there. Most entries are close to $30 and the appetizers are $15 or more. The interior was a bit dark and uninteresting and the music was quite loud.See all photos from Steve W. for Cactus Club CafeUsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationStacey S.Business Owner8/5/2018Hello Steve,Thanks very much for the five star review!  We are a smaller location and can get a little loud and lively when we are full with guests, however we are very happy to hear that your experience overall was great!We hope to see you again soon.Sincerely,Stacey SDay Manager, Macleod TrailRead more","Business owner informationStacey S.Business Owner8/5/2018Hello Steve,Thanks very much for the five star review!  We are a smaller location and can get a little loud and lively when we are full with guests, however we are very happy to hear that your experience overall was great!We hope to see you again soon.Sincerely,Stacey SDay Manager, Macleod TrailRead more"

"Jaden B.Elite '2021Calgary, Canada1317522158611/12/20172 photosI have been here so many times that when I sat down and looked at the menu yesterday I wanted to try something on the menu that I hadn't tried before and that was hard for me as I have tried almost everything on the menu. Everything from the modern bowl with all the different additions you can add to it such as salmon, tuna, chicken, etc. The butternut squash ravioli with prawns is my favourite and I have had that both in the meal size and in the starter size. The tuna stack is also delicious for a starter. I have had the salmon dijon for a main meal. My favourite drink on the menu was called a frose or a rosini as I like to call it. Well that was there summer drink so now they have a new one in replace of it called the blackberry harvest or something along those lines which is just as amazing and good. Highly recommend it. So to find something I hadn't tried for a main meal yet- I got the short rib sandwich and my boyfriend got the Rob's Chicken sandwich and both were amazing. My waitress suggested that I don't get the short rib sandwich as she didn't like it but I am glad I did because I loved it. Yes she was right that it could have used more flavour like a BBQ sauce or something but there was cheese and it was served on sourdough so it was great. Also, it was like a beef dip because you dipped it in beef au jus. I won't be getting this again because I have a rule when I go to a restaurant to get something different overtime and my boyfriends chicken sandwich was better than the short rib sandwich. The only thing I did not like about the restaurant and what I thought was weird was that they started vacuuming the carpet while we were eating. Yes I understand that they were cleaning but it was loud and that place is half carpet. I think they should just do it at the end of the day.because I have eaten so much from here, I have decided to write a full list of everything on the menu (past and present) that I have tried under every category on the menu and whether I recommend it or not. Updated at the beginning of February 2018: Drinks (Cocktails)- I have had almost every cocktail on the menu but none of the wines or beers: - Passion Fruit Bellini- RECOMMEND but tastes like a peach bellini with a gooseberry in it and it is seasonal - The Belinni- RECOMMEND- Whiskey Giner Smash- Recommend but the ginger is strong - The Brazilian- RECOMMEND this is my favourite drink - Signature Cesar- Recommend but it is typical- Signature Sangria- Recommend but it is a typical drink- Nothing but Pink- RECOMMEND- Flirtini- RECOMMEND- Frose: RECOMMEND but it is seasonal - Rosini: RECOMMEND but it is seasonal - Blackberry Harvest: RECOMMEND but it is seasonal Start and Share:- Szechuan Chicken Lettuce Wraps- RECOMMEND- Tuna Stack- Recommend BUT its becoming popular everywhere - Edamame- Don't recommend as it is too typical - Ceviche- Don't Recommend- Ravioli and Prawn Trio- RECOMMEND- Calamari- Recommend but its nothing special - Beef Carpaccio- RECOMMEND Steaks- Mains- Butternut Squash Ravioli with Prawns- Recommend but only in the Start and Share size - Fresh Greens- Modern Bowl with grilled Avacado- RECOMMEND-Modern Bowl with Grilled Chicken- Don't recommend- Modern Bowl with Grilled Salmon- RECOMMEND-Burgers and Sandwiches:- Cajun Chicken Sandwich- RECOMMEND- Rob's Crispy Chicken Sandwich- RECOMMEND- Short Rib Sandwich- Recommend but I don't think it is on the menu anymore- Casual (I have had and recommend everything in this section):- Chicken Tacos- RECOMMEND- Baja Fish Tacos- RECOMMEND- Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowl- RECOMMEND- Chicken Tenders- RECOMMEND- Jambalaya Rice Bowl- RECOMMEND-Desserts (I have had and recommend everything in this section especially the Key Lime Pie): -  Chocolate Peanut Butter Crunch Bar- RECOMMEND- Caramel Chocolate Mousse- RECOMMEND- White Chocolate Cheesecake- RECOMMEND- Key Lime Pie- RECOMMEND- Chocolate Lava Cake- RECOMMENDRobs Chicken SandwichShort Rib SandwichUsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationGraham A.Business Employee11/14/2017Hello Jaden,Thank you for taking the time to write a review for Cactus Club Cafe Macleod Trail.

"Vanessa M.Whiteville, NC55252510/3/2020I had my first visit and can't wait for my next.  Karen did my 60 minute deep tissue massage and she was absolutely amazing.  I explained to her what was going on with my shoulder and neck area and she worked magic with her hands and had me feeling like a new person when I left.  I hadn't been able to sleep for days before my massage because of post operative shoulder pain but when I got home that night I slept  the whole night with no pain.  She is very experienced and knows the perfect amount of pressure to apply.  The front receptionist was very nice and attentive.  I am looking forward to another session here with Karen.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationKeith L.Business Manager10/8/2020Vanessa!

"Amber A.Huntersville, NC037/24/2020I was really disappointed with the massage I received here. I booked an hour long Swedish massage because I just wanted to relax and have a nice soothing massage. My therapist talked to me the entire time and kept stopping the massage to explain things using her hands and the massage itself had to rhythm or flow to it and was just a bunch of what felt like poking and prodding. My massage was at 5:45 and was ended at 6:22. It was just an overall very disappointing service and for the price I feel a bit ripped off. There are other spas in the area and I feel like I should have taken my business elsewhere.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationKeith L.Business Manager8/8/2020Hi Amber.

"Crystal P.Las Vegas, NV0810/9/2020As much as I wanted to like this place I will say I did not have the positive experience that the reviews mentioned. I was a first time client and wasn't really introduced at all. Cathy did apologize in the end for not realizing I was a new client but there were many things that for me were not good. 1) there was no explanation to what was being done to my face. This worried me since I have very sensitive skin and since she didn't know me or ask any questions about my skin I feared a bad reaction. 2) During the facial someone was in the waiting area and due to no receptionist she went to check on who was out there. TOTALLY fine but there was no change of gloves upon entering and working on my face again :/. 3) after massaging my arms with body like she began working on my face again without washing or changing gloves. Like I mentioned before I have sensitive skin so I again feared the oil doing harm to my skin. Just like I predicted I had a major major major reaction and what seemed like clogged pores after this facial which as never happened to me in the past. I think the protocols with hand washing and changing gloves was a major issue for me! Leaving this review so that hopefully the owner doesn't provide this  to anyone else!!UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationCathy L.Business Owner10/22/2020I’m sorry you feel you did not have a good experience with me. I pride myself on good customer service. One thing you did not see is that I have sanitizer on my counter and use it repeatedly during the service and between going from the hands back to the face I use sanitizer and a hot towel to clean my hands. You experienced a purge after a facial that is not a reaction. A reaction after a facial is hives or severely swollen skin due to a reaction to a product. Breakout can be expected sometimes after a facial especially a hydrating facial like you got. Now as far as touching the door handle- since I had completely sanitizer it prior to your arrival I did not think to change my gloves but I did sanitize them but I will remember to change them in the future.  Normally when a new client comes in I go through a list of everything we are going to do but because I thought I did you the month before  I thought I would let you relax during the treatment during the treatment since I thought I already did that with you. . However the appointment I remembered being on the books was cancelled so that’s why I remembered your name.Read more",Business owner informationCathy L.Business Owner10/22/2020I’m sorry you feel you did not have a good experience with me.

Robert is a very likable man no doubt!

"Madeline B.Charlotte, NC021/6/2021We lived at Mosaic for 2 years and moved out this past summer. Our first year was amazing! Perfect location for everything we were looking for in South End and met our needs at the time.  We ended up re-signing our lease for the second year and everything seemed to go wrong after that. -The office staff was constantly rotating out and seemed to get worse as it went. There were tons of events each month when we first started, but over time they just kind of stopped (this was way before COVID hit).-The main elevator was broken every time you turned around which was the one closest to our apartment and was the only one that went to the top few floors of the parking garage. This was a huge issue when you came home anytime after 6 PM and had to park 6-7 stories above where you lived. -Our AC broke 7 times while we lived there! 7 times!!! The amount of times we had to wait to have it fixed was ridiculous and it wasn't until the week we were moving out that the maintenance guy told us it should have been replaced a few months ago due to how bad it was. I try to be reasonable, but when you are sitting inside an 80 degree box that is not ok. - Valet trash. This is a great service, but over time the people that collected it became awful. They would just throw your trash cans around and leave things everywhere. -You can hear everything! Our neighbors upstairs that seemed to have major anger issues, the cars/motorcycles at the lot next door drag racing at midnight during the week.-We constantly had to remind them we were moving out and already gave our 60 day notice. Our last bill I ended up being passed around to multiple departments and people to get a simple answer on anything. Where Mosaic was when we moved out I would not recommend to anyone. Great location, but that is the only thing going for it at all and there are plenty of other apartments in the area.

"Lindsey H.Charlotte, NC012/25/2020I've lived at the Mosaic for more than four years, which seems like a long time to live in the same apartment! It's quiet, and I love the location in South End. The maintenance staff is really quick to respond. The only downsides- parking isn't great for having guests over (but they have made some improvements)--- and for being one of the oldest complexes in the area with less amenities...you would think it would be more affordable.

"Joe Z.Gold Canyon, AZ117/12/2019Updated reviewWent to this place for bowling and was extremely disappointed with the bowling. Me and my relatives were assigned lane 5, and the bowling lane was low quality. The oil on the lane wasn't active and couldn't curve. I'm not sure if it affected other lanes but it was absolutely terrible. Second, the bowling pins just wouldn't go down. We only striked once when it was 16 pound ball with 14mph and very rarely spared. The bumpers also didn't really bump the ball. Finally, the attitude.

"Shawn L.Bayview Glen, Richmond Hill, Canada024/12/2021Well Moxies will be our first restaurant that the father daughter food cretic duo does. We will only be talking about the food that we ordered. My Daughter Ordered the Guacamole dip and it was really good (Refreshing) she ate it all. She also had the kids Buffalo chicken tenders and veggies The chicken tenders were more like nuggets, which was fine but not tenders. They tasted good but will try the chicken strips next time. The veggies were just a veggie, 6 tiny celery sticks As for myself I had the chicken strips and fries. I had asked for the fries to be twice cooked (Crispy) They came soft (Uber eats app) . I asked for gravy also and that came at a cost of $2 well that was 3 tablespoons full LOL Thanks Won't be ordering fries or gravy again. The strips were nice and crispy but could have other flavors for variety would be nice. Lemon pepper hmmmm I also ordered the dry ribs which I've had before They are very good and will order again but when asking for them to have salt and pepper This was almost unseen even on the bottom of the container. (I'll add my own next time no biggie)The over all dinner from Moxies was good but we would order with our experience from tonight's picks.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationGeneral ManagerBusiness Owner4/13/2021Thanks Shawn for taking the time to share your review.

"Valerie S.Charlotte, NC12612272/8/2021Had a great experience at this location over the past weekend. I had an issue with the Hertz car rental down the street, they did not have enough cars to rent one to me even though I had a reservation so Enterprise came to my rescue. I got online and made a reservation but then called this office to make sure they had cars available which they did. They had plenty to choose from and it worked out perfectly. Everyone that works there was very friendly and professional. They kept me in the loop on checking in, when somebody would take me out to the lot to choose a car, made sure that it was cleaned and sanitized etc as there was several couples checking in at the same time as me. I noticed from a couple other reviews that other customers have had similar trouble at this Enterprise location as I had with Hurtz so it sounds like it may be a risk that you take renting from the offsite locations on a weekend, but I am so grateful that this worked out for me and we were able to get on the road to the beach fairly quickly.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationCustomer ServiceBusiness Manager2/8/2021Hi Valerie, we are very happy to have provided you with such a positive experience.

"Hilde D.Charlotte, NC0112/5/2019We always use a rental from enterprise, always were happy with the service, however this time we got a little truck. The driving was fine, the price too. However when my husband dropped it off they found a 1.5 inch tear in the rubber of the back bumper.This little truck was driven from point a to point B. No stops for shopping, no messing with cargo in the bed, nothing.My husband went to visit his elderly father, his son, and that was it. He came back home.The person that received the car went straight to the back bumper....Needless to say, they kept the 200 dollar deposit and after a month and a half, we still need to pay them $40.00.The part new costs 50 bucks. But it is also something that they can do over and over again. We have seen un-dated blurry pictures of the tear, no dated pictures of the replaced bumper cover.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationCustomer ServiceBusiness Manager12/5/2019Thank you for your review, Hide.

"Sid R.Elite '2021Scottsdale, AZ15390344/24/2016We got a good price and the Camry we had ran beautifully.  So why two stars?  The agent tried to charge us almost a $100 more than our reservation was for.  Once that was corrected, he showed me the car.  It needed washing and vacuuming.  He washed and vacuumed it.  It was dripping wet - hadn't been dried.  We inspected the car, noting the one significant scratch, and went on our way.  About a half our down the road, we noticed the smell of cigarette smoke.  It became obvious that someone had smoked in the car and that the company had done nothing to mitigate that.  I also noticed that the gas gauge was on 3/4, not full.  Guess I need to check that rather than trust that a company like Enterprise would fill the tank or note it on the rental agreement.  They did neither.  The next day, we drove west in the morning, meaning the sun was shining on the rear of the car.  The inside of the back window was so covered with dirt, grime, and film that it was impossible to see out the back in the rearview mirror.  Finally, one of the features of the car I found while playing with the controls was the tire pressure monitor.  According to the monitor the pressures were 36 (LR), 38 (RR), 39 (RF) and 40 (LF).  Being that out of balance and that overinflated indicates a potential safety problem to me.  Obviously, Enterprise does not check tire inflation.  Again, the car was otherwise excellent, we were finally charged what we were supposed to be charged, and had an excellent 10 day trip.  I would go back here, but would be a real pain in the butt about checking our the car including making them check tire pressure before I got in.Useful 3FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationEnterprise R.Business Owner5/7/2016Thank you for your review, Sid.

"Sabrina Z.Gilbert, AZ22131812/17/20196 photosMy sons doctor sent us to this facility for his surgery.  Although all of the staff was pleasant, I became very concerned while waiting in the lobby.  This place was filthy dirty.  The windows to the lobby were so dirty inside and out you could write your name in the dirt.  There was a metal ledge inside with an inch of dust.  The chairs in the lobby are dirty.  The wall had food splatter on it.  The receptionist came over to inspect the carpet and explained they were just cleaned however whoever cleaned them did not move the chairs because there was crud,  paper and a paper clip under the chairs.  I had plenty of time to wait so I complained to the front desk.  She was very apologetic and said she would pass on my concerns.  I showed her a child's table toy with blocks attached to wires.  The colored blocks were black with dirt.  At this point I was thinking ""What does it look like in the back where they do surgery"".  I was assured the surgery rooms were maintained cleaner.  The hard floors in this place look grimy along with the one bathroom stall they had available for a waiting room that had over 25 people in it.  The button to the elevator looked like it hadn't been wiped down in a week.  Seriously, the bathrooms in Walmart look cleaner than this place.  When my sons surgery was completed, I had to drive around the side to pick him up.  This is when bad turned to worse.  The sliding doors to enter were 10 times worse than the windows and door in the lobby.  This was where my son was recovering from surgery!  Then when I entered I could still see a grimy looking floor and many surfaces that are NEVER cleaned.  I wish I had taken pictures of the dirty lobby but I didn't.  However, when I was waiting for them to let me in the side entrance I was appalled by the poor conditions that  extended into the inside of this surgery center past the lobby area.  Attached are pictures of the entry to pick up your loved one who has just had surgery.  The picture of the chair is an example of the filth in the recovery area.  The picture of the spider web is inside the surgery center where the patient recovers.    I have no idea what it looks like where they perform surgery.  If I had seen this place before the day of my sons surgery I would have never allowed him to have his surgery here. I will be complaining to the doctors office who performed his surgery.  The doctors personal offices where we were seen prior to surgery were impeccable and clean.See all photos from Sabrina Z. for HonorHealth Piper Surgery CenterUseful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationHonorHealth SupportBusiness Customer Service12/19/2019Sabrina, thank you for sharing this valuable feedback.

"Erin M.Phoenix, AZ0211/11/2020I had surgery at this surgery center a few weeks ago and it was anything but pleasant. The gentleman at the front door screening people was very rude from the moment I walked in. There was a mishap with my COVID test so my surgery time was rearranged. When I did go back to pre-op the nurse Anita was beyond rude with me. I had prearranged with the Anesthesiologist to place my IV due to past experiences. When she came in to place the IV I told her I wanted the Anesthesiologist do it and explained why. She told me she couldn't do that. After the IV was placed by what I think was a student, I was told they were unable to get blood and needed to draw from my arm anyways. When the nurse left my room at 12:45 she did not give me a call button and nobody came back to my room to check on me until 2:15 when the anesthesiologist and OR nurse came to take me back for surgery. I needed to use the restroom for over an hour of sitting in the room by myself and had no way of getting out of the bed due to the side rails being up on both sides and having the IV. The entire hour and a half of laying there I was listening to my nurse watch videos on her phone and laughing. I heard every other patient around me get checked up on multiple times during this time. The anesthesiologist was the one who helped me to the restroom and the nurse Anita still didn't offer any help when she saw this happening. The only positive experience was with the OR nurse, anesthesiologist Dr. Borrego, my surgeon Dr. Newman, and PACU nurse Karin. It is also impossible to get ahold of anyone at the facility for questions before scheduled surgery and concerns following surgery. I requested a call back to discuss this matter and never received a response. I am very disappointed in the care at this facility and will never be returning.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationHonorHealth SupportBusiness Customer Service11/13/2020Erin, I am so very sorry to read about this disappointing experience.

"Trish S.Phoenix, AZ51712/22/2020By far one of the worst run facilities I've ever been to.

I was called 5 separate times prior to review my procedure and pre-op details, confirm insurance ect. Told not to bring anything with, don't worry about ID, medical card as they had all that on record. 5 times I had this call, I thought it was excessive but most healthcare companies keep poor notes and don't know what the left hand is doing from the right. Check in for surgery, we need your drivers license and insurance cards. ....  also here is a bill that we think will be owed after insurance how will you be paying for that? Flabbergasted again by the calls I received just the day before, even showed her the numbers on my phone from the day before. No F's given by this peach behind the counter. I said you can bill me, that amount won't be accurate anyhow, and you have my info on record and I didn't bring anything as you guys told me NOT to. Now the nurses getting me ready for surgery, getting the IV, reviewing the same old what meds are you taking all the same conversations you have 1000 times, they were all very nice and had their shit together. My surgeon comes in, we head into the operation room and I wake up in recovery. Apparently they had no ""clean rooms"" available and said we would need to wait about 30 min, had my family go up stairs to wait in that lobby while I was waiting for the room. Over 3 hours, yes you read that right. Almost as long as my surgery itself it took to get a room cleaned. Even the nurses in the post op were making remarks about how embarrassing it was and unacceptable to not have a clean room available for me after such a surgery. Once we got the room some time after 4, surgery had been done since 12noon, as we got settled into the room we could all very clearly hear the lady in the next room talking shit about having to clean the rooms how it's not her job and she shouldn't have had to do this shit going on and on. That was lovely to hear, my family thought it was funny but I was so out of it I didn't care at that point. The nurses I had at that point were great. Then came the overnight nurses. By far the worst I've ever had. Not only did I have to constantly use the call button  each time I was in pain because instead of staying on top of the pain and being ahead of the meds wearing off it wasn't until I was crying out in pain, reminding them it was time for more. I suggested we keep a schedule for a more proactive approach to pain management and she said let us worry about that. She had no idea how to drain or deal with drains which are common after such invasive surgery. I asked her to empty out the fluid in the tubes and she said that's not needed. They she removed the ball drain off completely to dump in the toilet to flush. You don't remove it! You open the top squeeze it out in a cup and measure the liquid. I told her this and she basically cut me off and said it wasn't needed at this time. As you're laying there in severe pain, can't move, need help just to sit up or use the bathroom you're basically trapped and can't argue any reason and at the mercy of an untrained nurse who takes no pride in her job with no F's to give. My pain meds had worn off again and I used the call button asked for my nurse, 10 min later nothing. I pressed it again and was crying at that point and asked if anyone was available and was told they would find my nurse. Someone walks in the take my vitals and when I asked about my pain meds she said oh I can go get your nurse after this. Again the right hand doesn't have a clue what the left hand is doing. The next morning, the same crap, used the call button at 2:06 to ask for my nurse, 2:38 two nurses come in to help me go to the bathroom, I said that's not what I asked for. I needed to check to see if I could have the pain meds yet and so they left. 10 min later my nurse gets there, oh you weren't ready for your next round until 2:50, so that's why no one came in, not even to tell me but to make me wait crying there in pain for 45 min? So my advice, if you're having a bilateral mastectomy, reconstructive surgery this is not the place to go. They have extremely poor operations, their staff is not very attentive, and don't like to be bothered when you use the call button. If you want a facility that's ran well, makes your pain management after such an extreme surgery the number once priory DO NOT go here. Banner has a great facility off McDowell, the 5th floor is for female patients only and they know how to change dressings, drain your drains properly!!!!!!!! I asked to check out early, I was supposed to be there one more night, I asked for them to start the discharge paperwork because I couldn't handle being there another day to only feel ignored and not a priority.Useful 2FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationHonorHealth SupportBusiness Customer Service2/26/2020Trish, I am so very sorry to read about these disappointing experiences.

"Cheryl G.Cave Creek, AZ01069/10/2018I had a laparoscopic vaginal total hysterectomy at Piper Ambulatory Surgical Center. Nursing staff excellent. Center did inform me verbally several times that the anesthesiologist who was excellent, may not fully accept Medicare. I appreciated being verbally informed several times. What I did not appreciate is the fact that a certified surgical assistant would bill more than my physician, and that the service would not be billed to and paid by Medicare. There are several alternative options as assistants that can bill Medicare, why use a CSA. Perplexed as to why no verbal information or introduction to individual before procedure. That is wrong. As a retired medical physician who can afford the additional bill, I sympathize with individuals whose income is extremely limited and can not pay an additional $500. I think HonorHealth should consider the financial strain to their loyal patients.Useful 2FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationHonorHealth SupportBusiness Customer Service9/11/2018Cheryl, thanks for sharing this valuable feedback.

"John B.Indian Trail, NC5435/6/2015First to ReviewWe we're quoted insurance on 4 vehicles 2 which had full coverage. Three months later we find out that all 4 only have liability. Dimitri on the phone said he would fix this right away and not to worry. Six weeks later they draft $500.00 out of our account for a monthly payment. We find out then that our insurance increased from $2400 to $5100 a year. You know why he didnt say anything? Because we would have canceled then. Our full coverage insurance at Farm Beauro Indian Trail with Mark Rains is only $2400 a year ,why would we pay more then twice that amount. They made the initial mistake and had us driving a brand new car without full coverage. In fact they still owe us for the windshield on that car because we couldnt claim it because of their mistake. Please call Mark for insurance and dont make the same mistake we did.Useful 4Funny 1Cool 1Business owner informationDimitri A.Business Owner5/8/2015This is not an accurate representation of the facts.

"Amber K.Charlotte, NC55517/28/20201 photoOkay.... So I'll start from the beginning by saying this was my first time at this location, and they're definitely following all precautions with Covid-19. Upon my arrival, I was asked to sanitizer hands, and to fill out paperwork stating that I hadn't traveled, and as far as I knew I didn't have any symptoms. A kind faced gentleman took my temperature, and then pointed me to the direction of a sink, as to wash my hands before being serviced. I was then asked to seat at the station of a middle woman, (NOW THIS IS WHERE THINGS GOT DIFFERENT) she kept insisting on me getting a Jelly service, but upon reviewing their many options, I still wasn't impressed, but she was for a lack of a better word PUSHY. The young man from earlier, then began to explain to me in detail what made this experience (his words not mine) so different, and honestly I was sold. I chose my jelly scent, and mentally prepared myself for the ""experience"" ahead of me. I'll be honest, his pitch was better. The older woman , then began to provide what I can only call mediocre service. She nipped the skin on my toe, and failed to check if I were okay. The water was HOT, and she never asked me if the temperature was okay, or if I'd like it to be adjusted. The bottoms of feet were not scrubbed, and she kinda scrubbed on the sides. She never offered me a beverage, even though another guest was offered, and she failed to start or even instruct me on how to operate the massage chair. At the end of my service she dropped my shoes by their dying station (while people were still standing there), and then proceeded to tell me my total. My pedicure alone was 55.00, but regardless of the price, good service trumps cost for me ANYDAY, so unfortunate for her, she didn't get tipped, which is a shame because I'm an awesome tipper. While I did love the location, and was extremely impressed with their safety concerns, I WILL NEVER let this particular woman do any of my services again.Jelly PedicureUsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationLinh V.Business Owner8/11/2020Thank you for providing your feedback and letting us know about  this issue.We apologize that our customers service did not satisfy your expectations.

"Brittany L.Indian River, Chesapeake, VA13454326/6/2020I'm traveling and after a 6 hour car ride I needed an adjustment. I called ahead and was told the wait was about 8 people. With two doctors working I assumed it would move quick. I came in as a walk-in and filled out my paper work and sat for over 45 min. I watched the receptionist accept 3 people who had gotten there well after me while I waited. When I finally spoke up, I was told I was next. (But I still waited another 20 min) It took over an hour to be seen from the time I handed her my paperwork to the time the doctor saw me. If I wasn't in pain, I would of just left. Suggestions: manage your appointments better. You lose all credibility of a ""walk-in"" service when you cannot properly set expectations. I had a slim window to get serviced and I would have went elsewhere if the proper expectations were set.Updated my review. Dr. Allen was not only sweet but educated meUsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationClaire H.Business Manager6/10/2020Brittany,Thank you for your feedback. We truly apologize for the inconvenience you experienced. Typically new patients experience minimal wait times which are usually just enough time to complete your initial paperwork. We are sorry to hear that you experienced a longer wait time than expected.

"Ashley T.Chandler, AZ091/30/2020Overall, I had an OK experience here. The ladies at the front desk were super nice. My hygienist was great - effective yet gentle. She removed some stains from my teeth that I have been hating - so that was splendid! I even enjoyed Dr. Zahiri until she came up with my plan for care. I came from a small town in Ohio where my dentist was a family friend and he took care of my mouth as if it were his own. His main goals were to keep my existing teeth healthy so that they would last me a lifetime. It is frustrating since moving to Arizona to only find doctors who want to prescribe $$ earning treatments before they are necessary. Before moving to the West valley I FINALLY found a dentist in Gilbert that was SO conservative on their treatments plans and I just LOVED him. My last dental check up with him, I was told my teeth were all looking great. That there was one spot that they wanted to keep an eye on and two areas where there was a gap between my filling and tooth where decay COULD eventually occur. Dr. Zahiri came back to me wanting to put porcelain inlays in both of those areas - where there was currently no decay.. and she wanted to cap one of my back teeth which was also showing no signs of decay. I worked for a dentist office for years, so I KIND OF know what I'm looking at in a dental x-ray. I asked to see my x-rays and she could not show me any reason for this work. She said she saw it ""clinically"".. whatever that means. She blamed my concern on my defensiveness from past experiences and tried to console me while putting me through the exact same experience. It sucks because there was one cavity I probably really do need filled and do not want to return to this office.. I will be looking for a new dentist. Peace!Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationSheyda Z.Business Owner1/31/2020Ashley, thank you for taking time to leave us feedback.  A radiographic exam and a clinical exam (actually looking at the teeth) are required for a proper diagnosis, this is standard of care.  We take time to do a compete set of xrays, intra-oral photos and do a compete exam and oral cancer screening to make sure we are providing our patients the proper treatment plan.

I have been looking for a store where someone would spend about 20 minutes with me and help me figure out what I am looking for. This was the place that did it. Peter was helpful and asked some questions that really nailed down what I was looking for and sold me a Kamry K101 with an Igo-W so I can explore building and dripping. They offered to teach me my first build but I was pressed for time but thats on me. They have plenty of juices to try and several different brands to choose from which I am finding is important.

It's nice to find a shop that will actually take the time to explain stuff, especially where so many places seem to just rush you out the door or off the line.

"Stanford F.Pacifica, CA045/13/2019I lucked out and found Bellisimotto on Google after an EBAY purchaseI made got cancelled. The EBAY Seller from Italy was wanting more then what the buy it now listed it for. I spoke to Paul who gave me expert advice on which shock would work best for a Ducati 749 project bike I'm building. He took the time to send me pictures of the XXF11/31 which is what I was considering. Paul explained all the options/features so I couldsee how it would work for my build and buy with confidence. I'm building a custom subframe to lower the rear passenger seat, custom seat and exhaust. The Bitubo is dialed in SPECIFIC for the weight of me and my Girlfriend and it's design gave me the added clearance I needed for all the changes I'm making. The quality of this shock is Gorgeous. Randy and Paul gave me a sweet deal but it was their Customer Service which made this an easy decision for me. They gave me a great deal butthese Guys are the REAL DEAL.

"Ryan W.Phoenix, AZ264/29/2021I'm giving them 2 stars because my initial communication with them was great. Regina was friendly and Carlos was friendly and helpful when chatting through our project goals during our quote consultation. Unfortunately things went down from there.I was told I would receive a follow up quote within two weeks after the consultation. I did not hear anything back for a month, so I reached out again and was told they would look into it.Again, two weeks later, no response. I followed up again only to be told that ""the rep informed you that you did not meet our minimum"". Mind you that the only thing I was told during the consultation was that I'd hear back in two weeks, but I never did.Additionally, when I got an explanation, they claimed that there was a 5k minimum on projects and that ""the rep indicated to me that he told you that the day of the consultation"". I had told our rep that we were looking for 4k-10k for our project during our consultation. In fact, when I had asked him what their minimum was, he instead said that they don't like to give minimums and that he'd just like to know our price range instead (4k-10k). The Owner was the one who handled the last email response to me and clearly showed no interest in trying to keep my business. All they needed to do was ask me a few questions to clear things up. It's really that simple when it comes to earning and retaining a client base. Instead they decided to make assumptions and trust the word of a rep (who is no longer there?) about what price I was apparently willing to spend.I'm shocked, really.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationIrene L.Business Owner5/5/2021I contacted you several times regarding the rep no longer being with us.

"Angela M.Las Vegas, NV01611/21/2020Felt the need to give an honest review because my experience is keeping me up at night. Be cautious booking with 4c hair. They will say it's full service and includes a wash and a blow dry but my hair was not washed or blow dried properly. Soap was left in my hair after her second attempt of washing it. The blow dry was painful because it was being combed by the root wet and not stretched and dried to prevent tugging and breakage which would have been the proper method of drying 4c hair. She also did not completely dry or detangle my hair which made the braiding process hard on her and hard on me. The hair was so tangled it was being yanked as she tried braiding down the shaft. At one point I wanted to cry but I tried to stay polite because it helps keep the peace. I just don't think the stylist had adequate experience working with my hair type which disappointed me. I could've washed and blow dried my hair straight before the service to prevent the worst part of my experience from happening but when I called and asked about it they said it was included in the sew in service so I came with my hair unwashed and detangled in 4 braids. My service was for a sew in and it took 7 hours. I got seen at 10:45am and ended around 6pm. The sew in portion was good but the braids in the back could have been flatter if my hair was properly detangled. The stylist might say it was the length of my hair that prevented it from being flat but I have had my hair flatter than this and there's much bulk in the back. I appreciate the work my stylist Ashley did but I was very disappointed  with how my natural hair was treated. When I take this out I know it will be a nappy mess and it just felt like so much breakage was happening from her technique. Ashely is a lovely person but that doesn't constitute for a job well done. Really wanted to write this because I just moved here and wish I read something like this that would have helped me choose a proper salon for my black hair needs.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationAshley B.Business Customer Service12/19/2020Thank you so much for your faux review!Please beware, the account of events in review are false.This review was left by a person who came into our salon during a pandemic, utilized our salon, our products and services.

I responded""no I just wanted to know if you had ombre hair , before I make appointment"" then she quickly responded ""If you were a real client you would just make appointment""and hung up.

"Coda B.Tampa, FL7589179/25/2009First to ReviewI will never consider going to this ""stealership"" ever again. If I hear that someone is interested in a vehicle here my only response will be to ask why they would go all the way out to Apache Junction when I could easily punch them in the mouth and save them some time.First, I would like you to read something that these liars have posted on their site:""GUARANTEED credit approval for ANYONE! Even if you have bad credit or no credit you will qualify for financing. If you have had slow payments, bankruptcy, divorce, repossession(s), foreclosure(s), or marginal credit in your past, NO PROBLEM! We can approve financing for your new vehicle... GUARANTEED*!""These cheesy bastards had this same guarantee going when I went out of my way to check out what was a decent looking car. I went in with $1k to put down, an above average credit score, and a very decent full-time job at a fortune 500 company. They first said it maybe difficult to find me financing, being a first time buyer. That was understandable, but still contradictory to the ""ANYONE!"" part. So I did something that I had been very against through the entire experience of buying a car, I asked my parents to cosign for me. After talking to my parents and assuring them I would have no problems with the payment, they agreed. I was sure I would have no problems with the financing after the addition of their stellar credit.Keep in mind, this was also BEFORE the economic downturn.I completed the applications and went through the entire pain in the ass of getting my parents info. They said it would be less than an hour until they heard back about the APR and other specifics, so I went to get something to eat nearby. When I got back over an hour later without hearing from the kid who I was dealing with, I walked inside... and he was nowhere to be found. After finally finding someone by poking my head into random offices a man informed me the kid was in the back of the lot. I walked to the back to find him tossing a football around with a fellow slacker of a coworker.Waiting...waiting....waiting...Then, what do you know!? They COULDN'T get the financing! I couldn't believe these assholes put me through all they did to just leave me high and dry. They even had the nerve to try to talk me into the various POS cars that had been sitting around because no one wants an ugly POS car. As you could probably guess I got my ass out of there and quit letting these chumps waste my time.Two weeks later I was being handed the keys to the same year, make, and model car with lower miles at a certified dealership.I guess I do technically owe these dbags a few thanks: thanks for the hard inquiry on my credit report, thanks for  wasting my time and leaving me in a worse position than when I came, and thanks for giving me the chance to go to a dealership that could get the job done.Useful 19Funny 13Cool 12Business owner informationKevin U.Business Manager4/29/2011We work very closely with a wide variety of lenders.  While everyone is guaranteed to be approved for financing, not every one is approved for the amount they want.  I'm sorry your experience was less than satisfactory.Thank you for your feed back, it helps us as we strive to improve our quality in products and service for future clients.Read more","Business owner informationKevin U.Business Manager4/29/2011We work very closely with a wide variety of lenders.  While everyone is guaranteed to be approved for financing, not every one is approved for the amount they want.  I'm sorry your experience was less than satisfactory.Thank you for your feed back, it helps us as we strive to improve our quality in products and service for future clients.Read more"

"Jackie V.Elite '2021Orlando, FL19023216624/21/2018Updated review12 photosFriday April 20th, 2018PICU doctor Benari says we are ready to go home. We disagree. Our child is still struggling to breathe, she's not sleeping at all and is having a hard time getting rid of secretions. We request that another x-ray be done. This morning Dr Sterrett says the x-rays came back and the lungs are clear. Pneumonia is all gone. We are excited and he also says they're going to move us to peds unit until she is able to sleep without oxygen. Which is what we had been fighting for. Later in the afternoon Doctor Martinez comes by says Hey I'm gonna be your doctor on the other side and we just got lab results back that show food particles in the lungs. (So we were going to be released without all lab results being back) let's do more tests while you're with us. Ok. Next Dr. Galves comes by and says he's going to be part of the team treating my child on the peds side. Says we need to get her back on antibiotics because her x-rays from this morning are showing that she still has pneumonia. What? But we were told that those same x-rays came back clean. I am so incredibly dissatisfied with the aftercare my child received from the DOCTORS in the PICU I want to reiterate that 90% of the nurses and RT staff here are amazing and great but the PHYSICIANS need to stop trying to send sick kids home.See all photos from Jackie V. for UMC Children's HospitalUseful 8Funny 1Cool 2Business owner informationScott K.Business Employee4/23/2018We take patient feedback seriously, and would like to learn more about your experience.

Limited by insurance, our only options were here or a hospital in Summerlin and we emphatically chose here. We were 1st admitted on the Pediatric side for 3 days and sent home with continuing antibiotics. The majority of the staff there was really friendly and nice with the exception of a resident doctor who didn't let you finish answering her question before asking another. She seemed to be rushed and lacked bedside manner. PICU:After being home for a full day, my daughter took a turn and we had to call 911 due to her not breathing. (She has Cerebral Palsy as an underlying condition) She was transported to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. We have been here for 5 days now and I must say we have received nothing but the best care! All the nurses are amazing and the doctors as well. We especially love Dr. Judith Ben Ari Lazcano. She is so kind, charasmatic and speaks to our daughter, not about her. They are not in any hurry to get her out of here either. Children's Hospital:According to the hospital website, there's a family retreat room here for parents to be able to recharge. We have never been told about it and when I asked, the nurses do not know anything about it. Parental support is lacking. Especially for the parents who are here not wanting to leave their child. It would be nice if they offered a room with a shower, fridge, microwave, water cooler, where a parent could go to recharge, store food, freshen up change clothes etc. without having to leave. Child life program:  Our experience with Child Life has been almost non existent. When she was admitted the 1st time, a child life specialist came to triage and told her that someone in her unit would be coming by to bring her movies, games etc etc etc. No one ever came. We asked for her 2 days and still nothing. She was too busy we were told. Ok why get a child all excited with promises of fun and games and then not follow through. How frustrating. The second stay was the same. Someone showed up on day 1, promising fun, games and movies but again, 5 days and nothing.Read more","Business owner informationScott K.Business Employee4/23/2018We take patient feedback seriously, and would like to learn more about your experience.

"Jordan A.Henderson, NV0642/2/2019My son has spend the past 4 nights here. The doctor's are great, helpful and some of the nursing staff is great too. However, other nursing staff is just horrible. Here is an example:My wife had to pump her breasts for our baby at home. A nurse chastised my wife for doing this, as if it was any of her business. Then, later in the night, my son began to violently vomit. This same nurse laid him into his back while he was still vomiting. My wife yelled at her to sit him back up because he was still vomiting. This nurse looked at my wife, rolled her eyes at her and continued to hold him down as he struggled to get up as her vomited. We called for another nurse who came and helped us. We requested to never have her near our son again. You have to share rooms with other people. This is not bad except with every roommate my son had, he would develop an new symptom. They had a habit of moving roommates in and out of the rooms at crazy hours like 10pm - midnight. This would wake up my son and the new kid, who was being admitted. They would obviously cry and no one would get rest. My sons O2 and heart monitor chord kept coming loose. We called for a nurse to fix it and stop the ""beeping"". They use to come to the room when needed but they just resorted to calling you on the intercom, which would wake up the kids. After asking to fix the monitor chord, we waited for 30 minutes, no one came. My wife went out into the hall to get the staff and found a nurse outside our door scrolling through her cell phone.

Like they will move my child's crib from one room to the other and hit every wall on the way... they will enter the room and turn on every light for no reason....We had a room for my son and I, but they came in to tell me we had to move to a different/occupied one... the mom and child had their TV volume high, so I asked the nurse to if we could lower it, she did but like by 2 levels?... I had to wake up the mom and ask her if it was okay to lower it more, she was really nice about it and just turned off...

He helped me at the 49th street location where I got two units before I moved so that I could stage my house.  Then when I moved out and needed more units until I bought another home, he was the same person to help me out again but at the 52nd street location.  He tells me of the best deals for what I need every time.  The company is lucky to have such a good worker who is cool and smart and works hard and is into customer service.  He made me feel like I was not getting ripped off -like I have felt at other storage facilities around this same area in the past few years.  It's been a really good experience thus far!!UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationSonny N.Business Customer Service10/29/2020Thanks for sharing your experience at both StorAmerica 52nd and 49th St!

I had the club sandwich which was good chicken wasn't that weird creepy meat you get from your local pizza joint. Fries were thick cut and a nice change from the usual French fries. I Tasted the hamburger and cheese as well and I was pretty surprised, they didn't throw in a whole slice of onion the size of the patty which was a nice change. The gyro was good and the souvlaki was great apparently I didn't try either of them but I believe what my friend said.

"Keitan T.Surprise, AZ941037/3/2018If I could leave zero stars and still type a review, I would. I found this company through Groupon. I've been a steady consumer through Groupon for the last 10 years, and I've always had good experiences from the merchants I've found on there....until today. I purchased the Groupon and had an appointment for lash extensions booked for today. I was at another appointment right before, which was unexpectedly running longer than anticipated. So I called to inform them that I would be about 15 minutes late for my lash appointment. She informed me that I could be no more than 10 minutes late, and if I was going to be, then they would not only not let me come to my appointment, but would not reschedule me and would nullify my Groupon, and take it as a cancellation. I informed her that I wasnt cancelling, but was running late due to unforeseen and uncontrollable circumstances. She again reiterated the same thing. My husband is a business owner himself and could not believe the way I was treated. I contacted Groupon and got a full refund.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationKristina D.Business Owner10/18/2018Thank you so much for your review and giving Beauty Kouture the perfect opportunity to discuss our cancellation policy! Thankfully this review is not based upon the quality of our services but rather one of our policies. In order to avoid any miscommunications or confusions about our industry standard cancellation policy, it is posted publicly on all social media sites, our website and our online scheduling system site. Our spa policies are also included in the multiple emails sent prior to scheduled appointments at Beauty Kouture. Furthermore it is discussed thoroughly over the phone before first time client appointments are scheduled. Following this discussion we collect the information needed regarding the credit card on file we require in order to schedule appointments due to this cancellation policy. Cancellation policies serve a phenomenal purpose and ultimately can strengthen the 'Client-Beauty Kouture' relationship. Scheduled appointments are very important to Beauty Kouture and the team members of Beauty Kouture, as they are reserved specifically for the individual and service requested. We understand that sometimes schedule adjustments are necessary; therefore, we respectfully request at least 24 hours notice for cancellations.Understandably that when clients forget, cancel or show up late to scheduled appointment without giving enough notice, we miss the opportunity to fill that appointment time, and clients on our waiting list miss the opportunity to receive services. Although it is the clients responsibility to remember appointment dates and times to avoid late arrivals, missed appointments and the cancellation fee as a courtesy, our appointments are confirmed 48 hours in advance because we know how easy it is to forget an appointment that was booked in advance. In addition to the 48 hour in advance confirmation, we also send a reminder 25 hours in advance, thus giving another opportunity to cancel within our cancellation policy and avoiding fees. As the services are reserved for the individual personally, a cancellation fee will apply.  Less than 24 hour notice will result in a charge to the card on file equal to 50% of the reserved service amount.""No shows"" will be charged to the card on file 100% of the reserved service amount.  Late arrivals are considered a no show due to the result of the professional not having ample amount of time to complete the scheduled service with the upmost quality in mind. The cancellation policy allows us the time to inform our standby guests on our waiting list of any availability, as well as keeping our Beauty Kouture team members schedules filled in which their financial livelihood depends upon, thus better serving everyone. All of our policies are presented and provided in multiple sources with the intention of excellent servicing for our established and future clientele.

"pamela w.Miami, FL182510/22/2020BEST MOVERS are what they say- THE BEST. From estimate to finish they were the finest!  These guys loaded and unloaded us in a little over 24 hours and drove 10 of those hours.  WE moved to Destin, Florida from southpark.  2 years ago- we moved from 2 miles away and the movers did a lot of damage to our fine furniture.  they took over 2 days to get there.  These guys worked their butts off getting us unloaded, furniture placed, etc.  It was hot and sunny for the unload but they worked at the same pace on both ends.  We have a couple of scratches on the foot of one dresser and Juan went and got the furniture marker to fix it before leaving for the airport.  I can't say enough for these guys- polite and worked well under stress.  When things didn't look like they would fit- they somehow got it to fit in the truck, elevator, etc.  they didn't leave messes behind and after watching my daughter do a long-distance corporate move and seeing a guy walk off the job, the packers show up 2 days late (on the day of the move), I was really nervous about this move.  Our experience was fabulous!  Thanks again and I can't write enough good things about them.  so many movers use day labor that appear to be on prison release- these guys are all fine upstanding people that you wouldn't be afraid to be alone with....Juan is such a professional and so were his other guys.  And one more thing- our other estimates would have left us with a truck too small.  Thanks again!UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationJuan Z.Business Owner3/26/2021Dear Mr & Mrs Etter,We would like to thank you for trusting us to do your move from Charlotte to Destin, FL.

"Jennifer H.Raleigh, NC67116/20/20191 photoTwo words. Life Saver! I had booked another company to move me from Charlotte to Raleigh on Saturday, June 15. The other company told me the day of the move (which had been confirmed) they didn't have a crew and wouldn't that weekend, and probably not Monday. I called Best Movers. Within an hour, Mr. Zuluaga was at my house giving me an estimate. He moved me the next day, which happened to be Father's Day Sunday. They were on time, fast, quiet (it was early Sunday morning), and so courteous. They delivered my stuff to a storage unit, and the way they stored my belongings was nothing short of amazing. They took great thought and care in how my belongings were placed so I could get to some things if needed. And it was affordable. If you need a moving company, this is the only one you should consider. I cannot thank them enough for accommodating me on short notice on a holiday.The storage unit after they packed it for me.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationJuan Z.Business Owner6/29/2019Dear Jennifer,We are very happy to learn that you are highly satisfied with our services and quality job, we would like to thank you as well for your glowing review and we do appreciate your acknowledgment of our efforts to achieve our goal that is help our customers to have a smooth move and to support them in every new start, step or transition in their lives through our daily hard work, even when there is a holiday, high hill to climb, bad weather conditions to work with, or any other bad circumstances, we are committed to do our very best during each move.

"Leslie S.Williamsburg, VA26115/19/2018My husband and I hired the wonderful folks at Best Movers US to move our household from Charlotte to Williamsburg, Virginia, and we are absolutely thrilled with the quality of their work.  It began with the first phone call and continued through to a follow-up phone call we received a month after our move.  Throughout, everyone connected with Best Movers US was friendly, capable, and efficient and demonstrated that they cared about making our move as successful and stress free for us as possible.  We needed the company to do all of the packing, and the owner made two trips to our Charlotte home to be sure he had an accurate understanding of what that would entail and the materials and staff it would require.  When packing day came, the crew was exactly on time and worked diligently and carefully to pack every item and label every carton.  They showed the utmost respect for our belongings and did a great job of moving things within our house (and down our stairways) without damaging a thing.  If they had any questions about an item, they asked one of us and proceeded exactly as we advised.  The truck and crew arrived at our new home exactly on schedule and again worked diligently and carefully as they transferred every item from the truck to its appropriate location in the new house.  Everyone worked efficiently, but there was never the sense that they were rushing through things just to be finished.  As they had from the start, they showed that their first concern was making our move as successful and stress free for us as possible.  And they succeeded.  Now that we have unpacked every carton and removed the bubble wrap from every delicate item, we can report that not a single thing was damaged in any way.  This was not our first move, but our tenth, and if I could go back in time I would hire Best Movers US to handle every one of them.  Don't waste time shopping around - do yourself a favor and hire Best Movers US.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationJuan Z.Business Owner6/9/2018Dear Leslie,We want to say thanks to you and your husband for trusting us to do your out of state move, we are very happy to learn that our moving services are the best experience you have had within your 10 moves and thank you for sharing it with our future customers, we also feel honored to be your moving company and thank you for your recognition and appreciation of our efforts to achieve our goal, that is to bring a quality smooth move to our customers.

"Cynthia G.Countryside, Tucson, AZ701211/11/20172 photosI just bought a car from these guys from a Craigslist ad. Ad states perfect condition clean title asking $11,900 for a 2016 Nissan Altima. I should have seen the red flags but I like to believe there are honest people. We ended up buying the car for $10,500 on Monday Nov 6th, came back to Tucson took it to my mechanic where a bunch of codes came up I called them back on Wednesday and they say car is as is. My mechanic shows me so many issues that I feel the dealership should look at it we take it to the dealership Friday morning. They call us the same afternoon and say they don't recommend driving the car, the frame is bent, the codes that come up are longer than his arm and there are NO AIRBAGS. They say the condition of the car should be a salvage title which as mention before the car was advertised as a clean title. I've reached out to them again today via text to Work this out with them. The car is unsafe to drive so I'm left with a car I paid $10,500 for with no use to me. I wouldn't even give a star. I was lied to and taken advantage by these people who claim to be honest that he doesn't like to lie to people. They sold me a car with a salvage title without disclosing this to me. I've reached out twice today with no response. RUN ALL VIN #'s THROUGH  NICB.ORG.

"Tabitha C.Elite '2021Pittsburgh, PA1191353429/10/20201 photoI was pretty surprised at how tasty their pad thai was as I honestly didn't expect much from a non-thai restaurant. It was flavorful and not too much, my only critique is they put an excessive amount of eggs in. Love the noodles they use and great prices ($7-10) for quality fast meals. This location's staff didn't come off as very friendly but I am letting that go as a rough day.

"CarrieSol C.Phoenix, AZ2933/12/2013Horrible horrible horrible! We booked a party from a groupon we had purchased a month ago. We had called and booked it right away as soon as we received the confirmation from groupon. Since the groupon had been such a success they had very limited available times. We had booked a party for March 9 from 10am-12pm. This was ok for us since my daughters birthday was on the 14th. We sent out invitations to all the little girls and they have been so excited about this party for weeks. We were emailed the forms to fill out and we immediately faxed it back to them of the colors and name of the birthday girl. On Friday March 8 we called around 2pm to ask a few questions and confirm everything was ready to go. We were told they did not have us down for a party. They were booked up and nothing we could do. The person on the phone basically argued with us on the reservation and said this is why they don't like sending emails. Nothing was apologetic or not even a notion of helping us fix this situation. We were left to plan a party for 8 girls in less than 24hrs notice an we were left to inform my daughter that she would not be having a party at the place her and her friends have been talking about ever since the invitations were sent out. I am very upset with this company and the lack of concern they had. Not even an hour after speaking with them they posted on their Facebook page on how they were no longer emailing or faxing forms to book parties. Regardless of whether they received our forms or not they should have written down our name and number in the time slot for the time we booked over the phone. And upon reviewing their reservation book they would of seen that they had not received any paperwork from us and called us to see if we were still having the party. We faxed in the paperwork and I understand that they may have not received it but that does not excuse why we were never written in for a phones in conversation of time. I do not recommend this place unless you like disappointing your children.Useful 11Funny 6Cool 1Business owner informationTawnna D.Business Owner3/14/2013First of all, we don't know or have EVER heard of a Carrie!

"E S.Mesa, AZ3691617/28/2020Purchased a Yelp DealAccording to current Maricopa County regulations, face coverings are generally required in public establishments where social distancing isn't possible. Island Cleaners doesn't know and doesn't care. As of my most recent -- and last -- visit, none of their employees wore face masks, even in settings where direct interaction with the public is required. When I asked the store cashier about it, he didn't seem to be aware of their value.Although their dry cleaning services are stellar, their total lack of concern for the health of their customers is troubling. If you don't believe in face coverings, fine. But if you want to protect yourself from a contagious -- and possibly deadly -- disease in a state where the coronavirus pandemic has raged out of control, stay away from this place.Useful 2Funny 4Cool 1Business owner informationTracy B.Business Owner8/7/2020We only have one person at a time in the store everybody else waits outside and we have a 6 foot distancing and have move the cash register to accommodate this distancing.

"Renee N.Elite '2021Las Vegas, NV241597359910/16/20174 photosAlways looking to try a new French cafe and this place caught my eye one afternoon.It is located in a strip mall at the corner of Flamingo and Rainbow Blvd. it is a little hidden so just look for  the sign. When we walked in we were greeted by the lovely owner. The menu features French and Korean choices which I was surprised to see based on the name of the cafe. I ordered a ham/cheese croissant and hubby ordered the Croque Madam. Each entree came with a side of delicious organic greens and veggies. They were just delicious and so fresh. My croissant was tasty but hubby's sandwich was just ok. We then enjoyed some conversation with another one of the gals working there. The surroundings are a couple tables for two and a four top. The cafe features various local artists worksand many are for purchase. In addition, I purchased a couple of chocolate croissants and a baguette. All of my purchases were delicious.Overall we enjoyed our experience and although it was not the best French lunch we ever had, the warmth and friendliness of the owner and staff makes me want to come back.Useful 5Funny 1Cool 4Business owner informationKristin F.Business Owner12/23/2017Renee what a lovely review I am so happy that you thought I would pastries were delicious that is what we strive for here at Bonjour We hope to see you here soon again.Read more",Business owner informationKristin F.Business Owner12/23/2017Renee what a lovely review I am so happy that you thought I would pastries were delicious that is what we strive for here at Bonjour We hope to see you here soon again.Read more
"Stefany V.Las Vegas, NV304148671743212/7/201714 photosNew management has totally upgraded this little local bakery! Two sisters run this shop, with one in the front of house and one in the kitchen. The partnership works excellently, with tasty food served with attentive and genuinely caring service. The dining room itself is clean, bright, and nicely decorated, with art on display and available for sale. I've been in twice and am already on a first-name basis with Kristin!The bakery case is always full of beautiful desserts, but I tend to come here for lunch. The ham and cheese croissant is a good classic, and you can add an egg to make it even more indulgent. Their Korean fusion dishes with bulgogi come especially recommended and the burger I ordered had so much flavor! Their coffee drinks are super strong and well balanced, made with Lavazza.

"Taylor S.Denver, CO473853161419/28/20173 photosThe location is under new ownership, and having not visited before, I have nothing to compare it too. I'm absolutely fine with that though, because Bonjour Bakery & Deli was an absolute delight.I wanted a place to pop in for a quick breakfast and a coffee while I got some work done. They are located in a big shopping center, so there is parking aplenty. I walked in to be greeted by a pastry case of the finest treats. They have a large chalkboard menu, and some of their more savory breakfast options include omelettes, croque monsieur, and a ham and cheese croissant. And fear not. They still make the famous almond croissant that I heard nearly every guest order while I sipped my almond milk latte.This isn't the place where you're going to get fancy latte art, but I enjoyed the creaminess of the dairy alternative and the smooth flavor of their espresso. I devoured my ham and cheese croissant. They fly their butter in from France, and you can taste the difference as the flaky pastry dances across your tongue. The side salad that accompanied was a forest of vegetables with a champagne vinaigrette.What really caught my eye was how warm and welcoming the staff and owner were to every guest. They were greeted with either a warm smile or a warm hug. You can tell that they are really trying to build a community and take pride in what they do. This was a little reminder and taste of my time in France, merci!Useful 29Funny 10Cool 17Business owner informationKristin F.Business Owner9/29/2017Thank you so much for this amazing review, we hope that you will come back very soonRead more","Business owner informationKristin F.Business Owner9/29/2017Thank you so much for this amazing review, we hope that you will come back very soonRead more"

"Ashley N.Elite '2021Boston, MA415123994/14/20191 photoThe staff at Kodak is super nice & so helpful. Their interior is also very modern, organized & clean! The service I received was extremely high quality & I am ecstatic with my purchases.To start, I was slightly late for appointment with Dr. Jennifer Trac - literally running to the store because I got lost in the PATH. The staff was super understanding and checked me in very quickly, breezing through my pretest while asking me all the right questions and getting all the relevant information.Allan & Tate were extremely professional but still friendly during my visit. I felt really comfortable & confident in their ability to help me.When I went back to see Dr. Trac, she blew me away with her attention to detail and her ability to easily translate all her results into regular people language that I could understand. She was extremely patient in answering all my questions, and giving me an updated prescription that was definitely needed. Allan is actually a magician and picked out a beautiful pair of frames for me. They are light-weight titanium and suit my face really well, he has a great eye!Tate is the sweetest, he was on the phone with the insurance portal forever because the website for direct billing was down for maintenance when I got there. Their direct billing service is extremely convenient & definitely something I'll look for in the future.My glasses were ready in about a week & a half, which was expected because my prescription is kind of high and I added a lot of features on the lenses. The blue blockers are highly recommended by me if you spend a lot of time on a screen, it's made my eyes fatigue a lot less than they used to.I highly recommend you come! I think they have a discount for Ryerson students which definitely helps on the student budget, but regardless of who you are they definitely take your eye health seriously. Such an amazing experience, I'm blown away by the quality of service from this establishment.MODO light weight titanium frames with anti-glare, anti-smudge, high index, blue blocker lenses.Useful 2FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationTaylor C.Business Customer Service4/24/2019Thank you so much for your kind words, Ashley.

"Dino A.Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada076/17/2019Very rude. Terribly unprofessional with regards to appointments and timing. I was so surprised how rude the staff were.Update July 13th 2019:I do not see the truth behind your brand being ""all about positivity"" when the basis of this issue stems from me being spoken to incredibly rudely at your store. I don't appreciate the duality of treatment in person and on the internet - because it seems that customer service only matters when the truth is being posted for everyone to see. I also don't think an additional discount will rectify the unnecessary attitude and waste of time I was awarded when waiting for my appointment. UPDATE:My response to the company:It's great to hear that you set a high standard for your staff - but the fact that I was spoken to rudely from the moment I stepped into the store, I find to be incredibly alarming. Particularly given that the norm for eye exams is that contacts are to be replaced upon taking them out, and if not, for a contact lens containers to be provided - rather than have the customer all but request to use one. I also need not be squeezed for money and be told that I would have to pay an additional fee for a contact lens prescription. Additionally, if an appointment is made, then an appointment is to be kept - rather than change the ""assumed length of an appointment"" from 30 minutes to an hour, given that the optometrist themselves were running late. I shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes then be asked if there was somewhere I needed to be...All I could think about as I was storming out was that there was no way on earth that I was going to keep my appointment and PAY this lady to be rude to me. I am never one to cause a scene, but god I could not believe this woman was speaking this way to me.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationTaylor C.Business Customer Service10/24/2019Update for Yelp viewers: Based on the direct messaging conversation from July, we continued to apologize for the experience and tried to offer a solution, but unfortunately unable to work with individual to create an overall positive experience moving forward.

"Becki M.Madison, WI5222/6/2019I did not have a great experience at Healthy Vet. I brought my cat in because my normal vet was closed and I was leaving town. I felt like they used scare tactics to make the problem seem worse than it was, in hopes that I would come back in for another visit, to get more money. Everyone I interacted with (aside from the front desk) seemed condescending and inattentive. I feel as though my opinion/input was disregarded entirely.

"Seve M.Atlanta, GA2126/16/2018Came in to have my tires changed. They took receipt of the shipment from tire rack, which was nice. Price was about $60 which was a good deal, but work done was poor. The mechanics did not clean the rim surface before placing the weights, so they won't stay on long.  They also didn't clean off the old glued prior, leaving a mess. They used something hard like a screwdriver to remove the old weights, gouging the rim in the process and leaving scratches. The PSI of the tires was not checked prior to handing the car off either. Seems they just put enough to get the tire bead to seal as all four were between 24-26 psi.

"Ryan G.Santa Barbara, CA751246/3/20202 photosCustomer Service-When you buy any product, especially one that is a major purchase, you want customer service. That is exactly what Mike brings to the table when you go through LV Hot Tubs. He met with me in my home at my convenience to go over spa options. After the spa was ordered he kept me informed on when the spa would be ready for install. On the day of the install a complication came up with the depth of the hole. He was there through the whole process and worked late into the night to make everything perfect. This really showed his dedication to making me feel happy with the service and purchase. The spa is amazing and we use it all the time. Everytime I walk out into my yard i love the look of the spa. Mike even worked with the manufacturer to replace a small part that broke out of operator error. What more could you ask for? From start to finish he made the whole process smooth, easy and one that I would recommend for anyone even considering getting a spa. 5 stars isn't enough to express how happy I am after going through Mike for our spa. Just look at the pics....100% satisfied.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationMike A.Business Owner6/3/2020Ryan thanks for choosing me to be your hot tub guy.Read more",Business owner informationMike A.Business Owner6/3/2020Ryan thanks for choosing me to be your hot tub guy.Read more
"Veronica L.Phoenix, AZ5144572/6/2017I found out today that you shouldn't try to make an appointment here, apparently. I called the number listed on Yelp. A female answered and screamed ""TAKE ME OFF OF YOUR SPAM LIST!"" and hung up on me. I googled the number, thinking that maybe it was mistakenly associated with the salon on yelp, but it's connected with ""Lyndsey Williamson"" and Comb Sweet Comb all over the internet. I realize that I have an out of state number (AS DOES THE PERSON I WAS CALLING), but who the hell answers a call like that when you use your number for business?!To top it off, I texted the number saying that I was not a spam caller and was just wanting to make an appointment and sorry for bothering them. Do you think I got any response or even a sorry? Sure didn't.The photos for this salon are gorgeous, but I'm not willing to take crap from anyone for a good balayage. I'll spend more money and drive further to not be treated like garbage.UsefulFunny 1CoolBusiness owner informationLyndsey W.Business Owner2/8/2017Veronica,I'm so sorry I made you feel unimportant.

"Allison D.Toronto, Canada684623312/9/20183 photosI'm a big fan of Rolltation, and prior to relocating to a new office, I would very frequently either dine-in or order take-out (via Ritual) from Rolltation. In terms of ""fast food"", I really appreciated the quality of the ingredients and that the menu has some semblance of being healthy, with a colourful variety of veggies. When ordering, you can either choose from their set combinations, or build your own, then watch them assemble your meal. Look for the ""rice printer"", it's pretty neat! My favourite is the Teri Shrimp combination, with shrimp (boiled or tempura), creamy crab or ""kani"" salad, carrots, edamame, cabbage, cucumber, corn, and crunchy tempura bits. Delicious and refreshing, with lots of vegetables, it felt like it was a relatively well-balanced meal. The sushi burrito format does seem to be incredibly messy and awkward to eat and I found it difficult to bite through the seaweed wrap without all the ingredients falling out, although all the flavours, textures and sauces came together better in a roll (not to mention having a prettier presentation with its neat cross-section). The bowl is obviously easier to eat, but all the components are sort of separated from each other. If getting Rolltation, I almost always ordered through Ritual. I found that sometimes wait times could be long at lunchtime, and it was better for me to continue working at the office and then pick up my food when I was notified. Also, there is limited seating, while I think the tables could have been better optimized (considering the huge oval table in the middle).Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationChris W.Business Owner12/12/2018Hi Allison!

"Raquel M.Las Vegas, NV17937344/10/2021So we got a $25 gift card to come here, never been, so we thought we'd try it out. Had decent reviews so why not. Well we aren't coming back. The waiters and manager were AMAZING, but the food was BAD, like the worst food we ever tasted, we walked out feeling nauseous and hungry, I had to walk outside. My husband ordered the lobster and Steak combo with a side of Mac and fries. I ordered the cold water single lobster tail with side of steamed spinach and season vegetables(green beans). Both lobsters were inedible, it's was EXTREMELY FISHY, and so tough and rubbery I could barely cut it with my knife, also they dont use real butter with their  lemon butter fish sauce. The mac and cheese was so bad (idk what kind of cheese they used) I didn't even know how that's possible to mess up. Couldn't eat the spinach, and the green beans were plain. We waited extra for this food to come out for it to be inedible, wasted an hour, and all to order a new batch of food to go. Flavorless trout , mash potatoes were OKAY, house salad looks sad, Caesar salad had weird powder on it?  We walked out of that place spending $100. Never again, feeling pissed, never walked out of a restaurant hungry and sick at the same time.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationBonefish C.Business Customer Service4/12/2021Hello,We're disappointed to hear that you experienced some issues during your visit.

"K J.Gilbert, AZ056129/16/2020Updated review9 photosBodify states (see the photo of Jessica's email) Coolsculpting results are 20% fat loss in treated areas the first session, and 20% loss of remaining fat in treated areas the second session. You can clearly see I did not experience 36% fat loss. Also, notice back fat is reduced, which is not a treated area - I started a daily cardio program and lost some fat naturally due to these workouts.For $4,800, I expected to have close to 36% fat loss.On 9/10, Jessica and Melissa told me that I had ""amazing"" fat loss. I stated how unhappy and disappointed I was that I didn't have near 36% fat loss.Their solution was to ask me for more money to do a third session. I declined.It's unacceptable this is how they treat clients. You deserve better.See all photos from K J. for BodifyUseful 2Funny 1CoolBusiness owner informationMelissa M.Business Owner9/16/2020Hey Kim,Thank you for coming in and sitting down with my sister and I.

I want to address some of your comments. You and I have talked at length, but it's key for anyone reading this review to have the full picture. Your bra line does look different, and you are also wearing a different bra. We've taken 10s of thousands of photos and when someone wears a different bra, or underwear, etc, the fat can look different. We treated your abdomen and that is why we had you wear the same shorts each time, to minimize any potential optical illusions or distortions as demonstrated with your different bras. We are thrilled you started a cardio program and hope you keep it up. We do monitor weight. You did your initial treatment in Feb of this year and from then until your last follow up, you were down 2 pounds, so the changes you saw were not due to weight loss. We also have noted from our consults (it's key for us to document all conversations) that part of the reason you came to inquire about CoolSculpting was that no matter what you do, your stomach doesn't change, even if you lose weight.  During your consult, as with all consults, we showed you dozens of our own clients who looked like you and did the same plan we mapped out for you. At that time, you felt the $4,800 was in line with that type of results we showed you of our past clients and you opted to move forward.We have done 22,000 treatments and feel you got what we'd anticipate. As discussed, during your follow up, we wanted to ensure we were not overstating your results, so we sent your photos to CoolSculpting. They, as I let you know, asked to use your photos in their national campaign (thank you for signing the paperwork that indicates we can use your photos internally and for marketing purposes). This was an additional layer of acknowledgement for us, that we did achieve what we'd anticipate after two rounds of CoolSculpting. We have retreated 189 people for free at Bodify, so our integrity and Beautiful Results Promise is real and valid and hopefully by looking at the vast majority of our reviews, you'll see our clients feel the same. Those individuals we treated for free were done some because they did not see the anticipated changes in their body as promised, in your case, we feel we delivered on our promise after two rounds of treatments.Of course we don't love that you are not happy and that is why we offered a middle ground solution for you to simply cover the cost of the actual treatment so you could do another round.

"Scott D.Scottsdale, AZ227139/30/2017Very nice staff, office is nice. My first treatment did yield good results. Though there was significant pain the first 3 weeks. The second treatment they elected to use different applicators. Charged me a ton of money and 4 months later zero results. Not happy at all w paying for that. Mixed bag. But again, nice people. But results not worth the significant investment.Update in response to staff reply to my review:The second procedure was done in late February or early March.  So by the end of June it was 4 months and the results were not there.  I had become concerned after 3 months the results were not going to show, so I worked on the following:-Major diet, went to vegerterian lifestyle.-Stopped any alcohol comsumption for 60 days.-Purchased a cardio machine at home which I use daily.-Went to weight loss clinic where they gave me medications and weekly shots.  As a result, I lost 20 lbs since my first weigh in at your location.  If I came in, you would take your photos which would show reductions in subcutaneous fat.  You would then base a conclusion that your procedure is the direct cause of the fat reduction in those areas.  Which then you would put in your book of photos and use as an example to other people how ""well"" your procedure works.  The fact is, the second procedure did very little.  Any loss of fat since my first procedure is due 95% to my efforts.  From my experience, the results were good with the plate like applicators.  Very painful recovery, but it worked well and was worth the investment.  I had assumed we were using the same applicators for the second time around.  Instead, your team used the suction kind.  They do not freeze anywhere near the same volume of fat. But you charge the same amount for something that does not do as much.  There was no pain or discomfort during or after the procedure.  No itching, no numbness...which leads me to believe it did not work.  Going in to have you take pictures of me does not make the procedure work better.  So saying I did not come in June, July, etc has no bearing on my results.  You charged me $4K for something that did not work.For anyone considering the procedure, first see what applicator they will use.  In my experience, the suction kind do very little if anything.  When looking at the photos any Cool Sculpting provider shows you of other patients, keep in mind those people just paid thousands of dollars for the procedure.  Thus, its highly likely they are dieting and exercising more due to the investment and to see results.  Not many people will pay that and keep their diet and exercise levels the same as they were pre-procedure.  Also, if a provider says they have done thousands of procedures, thats great.  But their books of clients may only show 50 or so.  So if a provider did 5000 procedures and their book is showing 50 client examples, thats 1% of their work.  1 client out of 100 made that book, you are looking at the top 1% of results.  If you are already skinny and just looking for a small reduction in an area, then maybe this is for you.  But if you are 30 maybe 40 lbs over weight and want some reduction, look at liposuction.  In the end it costs less than what I did and the pain/ recovery was about the same.  And with lipo you will get clear results where there is no grey area.Useful 4Funny 2CoolBusiness owner informationMelissa M.Business Owner10/23/2017Hey Scott,Thanks for being open and honest about liking the staff.

CoolSculpting takes 2-4 months to see full results and if, for some reason, we don't see an additional 20-25% reduction after your second treatment, our policy is to retreat you for free!However, if you don't come in for follow up appointments we have no way to know.You've experienced us after the first round and follow ups and you know we are honest and stand by our work so I urge you to call, set up the 3 follow up appointments that were never booked and let us make it right if CoolSculpting didn't do it's job.

The applicators we elect to use are 100% dependent on how your tissue sits, how much you have and if it is tight or can be pulled up easily. The majority of applicators are suction based, we used the flat, the coolsmooth pro applicator on you initially as your tissue was thick and didn't pinch well. The 2nd round, because it reduced in volume, we were able to use the suction applicator.

"Anahit B.Las Vegas, NV595239/17/2018I can't say enough good things about this place, but I'll try...1. From the booking to the treatment to the checkout was a breeze. 2. The office is very cute and super clean. That's something that's very important to me. It shows pride in your location and attention to detail which is much appreciated 3. I was nervous about my treatment. People complain about pain and I'm very low pain tolerant. I'd say discomfort not pain. I kept telling myself I'd be numb after 10 minutes and I fell asleep before I hit the 10 min mark. 4. The massaging after removing the applicator was probably the most uncomfortable part but it's for a few seconds. ANYONE can do this and if you are... go to Bodify.

"Mary K.Glendale, AZ9862/9/2019Out of all the places I could have gone to for cool sculpting, I feel very lucky to have ended up at Bodify. The first thing I noticed is how caring and compassionate the gals are. They've created such an open, clean and comfortable atmosphere; I'm also offered coffee and tea every time I go in..and the coffee is perfect for my fellow coffee fiends!Most importantly, I appreciated them caring to inform me on every step of the process. I'm someone that likes to know the why's and how's before getting into something. They answered all my questions before I could even ask them. The procedure itself was easier than I expected it to be. I was told there would be discomfort and that it differs for everyone, but I found it to be a walk in the park! All I felt was a little cold on my belly, but that's to be expected. I chose cool sculpting when a round of bad liposuction left me with protruding fat pockets and a traumatic experience. I felt confident before and after my treatment that the ladies at Bodify know exactly what they're doing.Thank you all again for taking such good care of me,Mary KUsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationMelissa M.Business Owner2/10/2019Mary,We could not be more grateful that you found us, from the moment you stepped into the officr, we adored your positive energy, inquisitive mine, and kind attitude.

"Brittanie H.Elite '2021Charlotte, NC3903535326/11/2018My sister and I came here on a Monday to find her a new pair of shoes. My sister has special needs and her feet tend to turn inwards when she walks. The shoes she had from the beginning of the school year were worn out and needed to be replaced. Unfortunately, when it comes to shoes, sometimes it can be a bit challenging to find a pair that is supportive enough so she doesn't have to wear the painful orthotic inserts that she's been prescribed.In search of another pair of Asics, we ended up here at Run for Your Life. I called earlier in the day to see if they sold Asics for children and they stated that they did. We showed up about two hours later and we were warmly greeted by Windy. She was extremely attentive to my sister and analyzed her feet and shoes thoroughly as well as her gait and recommended a shoe based on her analysis. A cool pair of New Balances.  When she put them on, the difference was like night and day. Immediately, I noticed that her ankles were upright. When she watched her walk and saw her heels were slipping she altered the laces into a special formation that stopped the slipping. I was impressed to say the least. I called my Mom so she could give her approval. Unable to reach her, I asked Windy if they could be held. She obliged without hesitation and we left. After leaving, my Mom called and said she would head over and that I too should pick out some shoes. After a Starbucks break, we headed back. This time, Lexi analyzed and measured my feet and informed me of what I should be looking for in a shoe. She brought out three options, from 3 brands: Mizuno, New Balances and Adidas. She also let me demo a special pair of socks to try on too. The two together made all of the difference. I noticed a huge difference immediately, even with the shoes I ended up liking the least. I tried on each pair and Lexi watched me walk in each and agreed that the Adidas appeared to be the best option.  We purchased both pair and bought the socks on a buy 3 get one free special. My sister ended up wearing her shoes out of the store and donating her others to their Samaritan's Feet donation collection. I later returned mine after finding a deal at a bulk retailer that they simply couldn't afford to match as a small retailer which I understood completely. Even still that doesn't negate the outstanding experience we had. We will continue to patronize them, especially for my sister's footwear needs. One thing I found really cool is that they offer more than shoes and apparel. They also offer workshops, classes, training, races and fittings. Really a well-rounded business. I really enjoyed my visit and would recommend then highly for running shoe needs.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationBrian M.Business Manager8/8/2018Brittanie,Thanks so much for allowing us to meet your amazing family!

"Debra W.Elite '2021Charlotte, NC58255717815/12/2018I am not a runner. I do not know much about shoes or anything of that nature. But I was looking for a particular pair of shoes and after going to Northlake Mall and visiting each shoe store and unable to find what I was looking for - I called Run For Your Life and they had a pair of Asics Gel Nimbus and in my size. They were actually closing soon but the guy told me they would wait for me if I was coming. Honestly, I was hesitant. Why would wait for me if they were closing but I took the chance and headed that way. They waited. And I was greeted with the most wonderful experience ever. He asked me why I was looking for the shoes and what I would be using them for. I told him I was going to be doing copious amounts of walking and needed something that would provide a lot of support. Call this crazy but he actually sold me shoes that were cheaper (much) than I had asked for. He said there is more to a shoe than just the shoe. He took into consideration how I walked, the arch of my foot, my ankles, my knees and so much more. I was a little taken back because when we went to put on shoes, they actually went to the put the shoes on my feet for me. I was like wait, what?! This is a thing? Mind blown. And the socks they had me put on with the tennis shoes (I was wearing no show dress socks) were amazing. I never in my life knew  a sock could feel so good on your feet. I bough 4 pairs that day. The staff here is amazing. They are well versed in the shoes and getting the right fit for you. But they know what they are doing by selling you the right shoe - even if it is a cheaper option. I came back and spent more money. We ended up coming back to get some walking flip flops that were $50-$60 each and they are amazing. It is like walking on clouds. I love flips flops but let's face it - they are not so great for your feet. But now I have the comfort and support I actually need. They have a new life long customer in me. Any time we need any type of ""tennis shoe"" we will be coming here.Useful 6Funny 2Cool 4Business owner informationBrian M.Business Manager8/8/2018Debra,We're excited to have you as a life long customer!

"David S.Elite '2021Forsyth, GA271646022/1/20208 photosJan 30, 2020My 2nd time visiting the Door & Trim Store.I had stopped in several months ago to look over some trim for when we installed our new wood flooring. Everyone was helpful the first time I went in, so I decided to come back. The first time I went in they spent about 20 minutes explaining options, materials, pricing, corner pieces etcI arrived today and was immediately greeted by 2 store employees. I let them know which trim I wanted and the quantity. The prices are much lower than what Home Depot & Lowes want for the same thing. The ordering process was very quick and easy.I needed delivery because the trim pieces were 17ft long. They quoted a delivery charge of $65. This was quite reasonable in my opinion considering I live about 22 miles away, and how quickly they could deliver. The delivery was scheduled for the very next day.The important part for me was due to the pieces being 17ft I won't need to join together as many cuts on my longer walls. Less joining means seamless lengths. I received a phone call the next morning indicating delivery would occur in the next 1/2 hour.The driver arrived and unloaded the trim. I noticed several pieces were damaged and noted it on the delivery signature sheet. The driver indicated to call the office and they would assist me.By the time I got a chance to call them they were calling me to have some pictures sent over so they could evaluate the damage. They let me know a few minutes later they would replace the pieces and bring them by that afternoon.The replacement pieces were dropped off as indicated.Overall a very good experience with them, and very satisfied with their resolution so quickly on damaged pieces. I will use them again if we replace out more.The store had a few cases of trim examples, quite a few doors to choose from, and accessories. Everyone was friendly.See all photos from David S. for The Door & Trim StoreUsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationArmando O.Business Owner2/5/2020David, wow!  Thank you so much for this awesome 5-star review.  We really appreciate you choosing us and helping to share the word about us.

He was able to diagnosed the issue over the phone and advised I can just get a handyman to do the work he suggested. Just got done with the handyman and my door works again!

"Marie C.Elite '2021Las Vegas, NV981962074/21/2018Brandon, joe, and his team are the WORSTTT. I've never regretted a purchase so much. Be prepared to get yelled at over the phone when you ask for an exchange and to have your words twisted by all these people and FALSE POLICIES to not get your money back. They never have the same story because they are a bunch of liars. Horrible salesmen I can't believe they still have a job. I will make sure I never recommend anyone here. And oh and be prepared when you go pick up and exchange to not even have the right mattress you asked for so you can argue with the salesman again. They do not care about their customers because if they did they wouldn't have treated me so bad and made me waste my time picking up a mattress that I AGAIN did not request for.

"Nathan K.Peoria, AZ58961/27/2021The gym is small and hot as others have stated. I didn't really do a proper tour before signing but I thought the pricing and length of contract were overpriced for what you received in return. Nevertheless, I signed up and went two days after for my first workout later in the evening and noticed that people were walking around not wearing masks. Now I don't care what your position on masks are but as is stated by AZ DHS, and considering as of January 2021, we currently have the highest infection and death rate  in the country, masks are required to be worn if inside a gym. I was obviously concerned by this,  particularly when one of the girls that wasn't wearing a mask was coughing so I left before my workout was complete. I called the owner, Wade, the next morning and explained my concerns and his response was ""You really think masks work?""  As a matter of fact, I do, considering I go to Arizona State University and have gained extensive knowledge in the field of human diseases and transmission by my great professor who is also an epidemiologist. Regardless, non-enforcement of masks violates the state's mask mandate and that's the exact reason I both cancelled my membership and reported the gym to the Arizona Department of Health Services. It seems that non-enforcement is a common issue in smaller gyms and I am happy to have signed up as a member at Lifetime Fitness who followers CDC guidance and the mandate outlined by AZ DHS.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationGlendale AZ A.Business Owner1/27/2021We clean our gym top to bottom daily.

"Tricia S.Peoria, AZ78122/20/2020I've been to many gyms, but this one is different. Let's face it, walking in a gym can cause anxiety for some and being confronted by the personal trainers, to buy a package of sessions, can cause even more apprehensiveness upon walking through the doors. NOT THE CASE HERE. For the first time I am in a gym where I feel comfortable. I can use any part of the gym and not have the ""this area is not for you"" look. There is a sense of community and people are friendly, they clean up after themselves. Janelle and Wade are great, they really care about this place and it shows.  If one feels timid about the gym, I urge you to give this one a try.

"Jessica P.Peoria, AZ03493/9/2019I wanted to check out this place because it's literally across the street from my home. I checked out the website, Yelp and Google reviews.  I could tell that the place was small and had limited equipment but I honestly didn't need much. The reviews were mixed between love it and hated it. Soooo, I thought I'd check it out for myself. I called and spoke to the male owner over the phone many months ago. I asked about the gym, size, machines/free weights offered, classes, etc. When I made a remark about the pricing his whole attitude changed. Suddenly the guy wasn't interested in the conversation and became a jerk. In a nutshell, I wasn't impressed. Rude owner and the gym is extremely overpriced at $33/mth. There is also a start up fee and a contract required for membership. While I understand Anytime Fitness is the low man on the totem pole.... No similar gym requires a start up fee or a contract anymore. Each similar gym out there offers a basic membership for $10 and is double if not triple the size. I'm all for supporting small business but it's just highway robbery in my opinion. If they got ride of the start up fee, improved customer service, removed the contract and lowered the pricing to say... $20.... I'd happily become a member.Useful 2Funny 3CoolBusiness owner informationGlendale AZ A.Business Owner3/12/2019Hi Jessica,Thanks for your review.  We welcome you to stop by our gym and get a tour and talk directly to one of our current members.  One phone call doesn't reveal the whole story, we are sorry if we seemed rude.  Here is how one of our members recently reviewed our gym:Recommend Score 10 - Extremely LikelyRecommend Comment This place is more than just a gym.

"Joseph B.Beaumont, CA1089868/19/2016So as previous reviews have noted, if you're a true gym rat avoid this place like the plague. The owner Wade is one of those white Bible thumper types that's talks with a ""Oh, gee golly heck"" and he knows nothing about fitness. All of this is very obvious when he CONSTANTLY will interrupt your workout to ask you why you're doing a certain movement or why you're deadlifting without shoes on. You would think that you would have to know something about weight lifting before you owned a gym, but that's not the case. Wade recently purchased pads for deadlifting but expects you to quietly set down 225lbs on them. God for big you break a steel bar or plates. Why even buy the pads? If you choose to workout here your training will be interrupted constantly by people who do not train. Oh, they're in the gym and they're doing movements, but they're not training. They're mostly doing one set and then interrupting other's workouts. The gym overall is missing a lot of equipment and you'll find yourself compensating a lot for the lack of supplies. This location is another Planet Fitness. It's only a matter of time until they ban deadlifting and put alarms on all of their weights. True gym rats beware.Edit: Since I posted this review, Wade the owner has reached out to me and offered to knock a month off of my monthly payments if I took this review down. Something to keep in mind when you wonder how many negative reviews he has successfully been able to hide from you.Useful 6Funny 5Cool 1Business owner informationGlendale AZ A.Business Owner8/21/2016Thanks for your feedback.  We are sorry this gym is not what you are looking for and hope you can find a location that better suits your needs.Read more",Business owner informationGlendale AZ A.Business Owner8/21/2016Thanks for your feedback.  We are sorry this gym is not what you are looking for and hope you can find a location that better suits your needs.Read more

"Sharon D.Northeast Calgary, Calgary, Canada13327/2/2017I went here for the first time a few days ago. Went it, told the guy at the door that I had never been to the store and a friend of mine recommended it. No warm welcome, no explanation of the process or the store layout. He looked at me, told me I had to put the books down that I had brought in, and that he was going through some else's books first and I would have to wait. Never checked with me if I had any questions or if I needed any assistance. Told me, ""Store credit only, no cash."" and that was about it. The girl at the cash was pleasant, but based on the non-welcome from the other guy.. not what I had been expecting.

"Michele B.Tempe, AZ344/4/2014First to ReviewHow does this place stay in business?  Because there are people like me who fall victim to their sales pitches.  People like me who are in pain and will try anything.   All they have you do is walk on a piece of paper and then they disappear for a minute and viola, they have the fix.  It seems too good to be true, because it IS!  For about $300, I got a pair of little plastic pieces.  They will try to sell you three for close to $1000.  After they run your credit card, they pull out a piece of red paper that has a statement saying they don't give any cash refunds - you have to sign it.  What a fool I am!  I should have left then. But it is so quick and the people who work there are such good salespeople, UGH!Learn from my $300 mistake.  Go to a doctor or physical therapist and get a prescription for anything you need.  Do not go to Good Feet!Useful 13Funny 2CoolBusiness owner informationEric K.Business Owner4/16/2014Included in our price is a life time warranty on the arch support which covers cracking and flattening of the support.

"John M.Andover, MA032/19/2017I went to the Morpheus Clinic a while back and after a short conversation, was told that I was not hypnotizable.  Hypnotizability is seen as an ability, and not having it appears to be a handicap.Hypnotists who think like this are behind the times, and need to go back to hypnotism school.Useful 2FunnyCool 1Business owner informationLuke C.Business Owner3/8/2017Thanks for your feedback.

"Veronica D.Mesa, AZ19611110/3/2011Really unhappy with this place. I have gone there a few times and the massage was good. I was always bothered by the fact that they NEVER answer their phone. They always call you back a few hours later. So I wanted to schedule a prenatal massage on my birthday and I see on their website that the prenatal massages are $49. So I leave a message, the woman calls me back about 6 hours later. I confirm the price with her, and she says, no, this is a specialty massage, it's $60. So I tell her, your site says $49. And she argues with me! Then she insists on taking my credit card number before she will set the appointment. I thought about it all weekend, and it really irked me that she was trying to overcharge me over their advertised price. I just called and canceled. I won't be going back there. That's not how they should be treating their customers, especially when money is tight and a massage is an optional luxury.Useful 14FunnyCool 2Business owner informationRussell W.Business Owner3/24/2013Dear Veronica, Please accept my sincere apology.  We never permit anyone to return a phone call  who does not know exactly what we have to offer so I'm not sure who might have returned your message.

"Gabrielle L.Montreal, Canada10225622479/14/2018My aunt took me to this restaurant on Wednesday night for my birthday. I picked this restaurant after seeing so many good reviews online and I thought I saw $30 for a tasting menu which I thought was too good to be true but wanted to try. I thought it would be small portions but such a good deal! So apparently the restaurant took it off the menu because what they meant was that you had to order an appetizer, main  and dessert and for $30 extra you could get additional dishes on top of what you ordered. It was a bit confusing and misleading so they removed it from the menu. We were the only ones in the restaurant that night but that was because it was their first week open on a weekday. FYI the resto has been open for 5 months now. I'm not complaining that it was dead because we got amazing service!! It probably helped that we were the only ones there. First of all the menu is edible!! That is so innovative!! I've never seen that before. The menu is printed on a parchment of potato. So she sprayed the parchment with this sun dried tomato-basil liquid and we ate it. The liquid gives it its taste because otherwise it really would taste like the host that you get at mass except instead of it being made out of bread it was made out of potato. We ordered a glass of cava each. Next we got a zucchini basil fritter. It's basically a round pan fried zucchini ball with homemade sriracha and mayo. It was good and I like getting extra stuff that is not on the menu. We shared the scallop appetizer. The presentation was nice because it came in glass case and when she lifted the lid all the smoke came out because it was a smokey scallop with daikon purée and maple syrup sauce. It was good! It wasn't sweet at all. We also got bread and the homemade butter was so flavourful and creamy. Then they also gave us a piece of ricotta paired with peach! It was so good! I wouldn't think to pair cheese with peaches. This was not something we ordered. Again I love getting stuff that is not included in the menu.Next we had a trou normand to cleanse the palate which was a sorbet with local gin from Quebec. It was so fruity and refreshing! Then I had the veal filet with red wine sauce, mushrooms and parsnip purée. It was delicious! The portion was bigger than i thought it would be. My aunt had the trout filet with roasted potatoes, asparagus, leak and saffron cream. She really enjoyed her fish. I didn't try it but it looked delicious and  crispy. She also had another glass of cava and they filled it to the rim!Lastly we ordered one dessert and once the waitress found out it was my birthday she gave us a second dessert for free. That is so nice! I really appreciated it. The chef came out and put a parchment of wax paper on the table. Then she put  blueberry jelly on the wax paper, an edible yellow flower that tastes like grapefruit and sprinkled blueberry powder and lemon ball herbs. She put strawberry sorbets and something similar to s'mores with vanilla marshmallow minus the chocolate inside but she did put some chocolate ganache on the top and a bit here and there on the table. There was also a rhubarb compote with turmeric and cinnamon crumble. It was quite a spread. We were so full but the dessert was very light and very pretty. I definitely recommend this place!! The service is amazing! I felt so special and the food was so good!Useful 1Funny 1Cool 1Business owner informationNicolas D.Business Owner10/4/2018Hello Gabrielle, Thank you for the amazingl feedback, we are glad to hear that your Aunt and yourself had a lovely experience at Chef's Table for your Birthday.We hope to see you soon to try our new menu.Read more","Business owner informationNicolas D.Business Owner10/4/2018Hello Gabrielle, Thank you for the amazingl feedback, we are glad to hear that your Aunt and yourself had a lovely experience at Chef's Table for your Birthday.We hope to see you soon to try our new menu.Read more"

"Lori P.Elite '2021Enfield, NH7715826910/2/20181 photoThere aren't enough words of praise that I could possibly give this place to even begin to explain my awesome experience I had here. From the second I walked in the door to the time I walked out, I was so happy. The service, the food, the wine, the ambiance, everything was so amazing. Although very expensive, I didn't even care because the experience I had was so memorable, it was worth every dime. The plates are really small so when they brought out ""the appetizer"" that included 2 think beet slices with a sauce on it, I thought, ""ok, so this is how it's going to be. I'm going to leave here broke & starving"". Yeah, not even close, I left stuffed & happy. It was incredible, Their presentation of the meals is entertaining enough. They really do want you to have a great experience & it shows. They came out with a new dessert the evening that I dined there. Although I had declined dessert because I was so full, I didn't think I could fit anything else in my stomach, a waiter came over & said he was so excited about this new dessert that they would give it to me for free because he said ""you have to try it"". They laid out a piece of wax paper in front of me & made the dessert right in front of me. I really couldn't believe it. It was incredible! I cannot praise this place enough.

"J Y.Burbank, CA054/12/2021The very first rule in business is NEVER ever blame the customer for your own shortcoming/mistake.  The owner Mike is simply unprofessional and flat out greedy.  Please DO NOT pay in cash as this guy could circumvent paying taxes for his benefit.  He tried to charge for credit card processing fee $$ to make me pay in cash.  IRS would probably love to include his business as audit sample...Please also keep in mind that he overbooks the rentals which means YOU as customer must accommodate his busy schedules. You will see how many times he says he is so very busy and doesn't even bother to leave a voice message with critical info such as being over one hour late... it got better when Mike blamed me for missing his call!

"Victoria L.Elite '2021Concord, NC154729612313/15/20191 photoThis is my third time eating at this chain.  It tastes more like ""authentic"" food, and less processed than most fast foods.  They did turn me onto ""MexiCoke,"" which is a wondrous thing.  The service is slow as molasses.  The last time I went, the line started at the door.  There were some communication issues with one of the workers who seemed to be hearing impaired or developmentally challenged.  He couldn't understand what I was asking for.  The customer beside  me said she had gotten on line twice, due to the fact that this young man was unable to accurately fulfill her order(s).  Whomever made the decision to put this individual on toppings/condiments put the customers in a terribly precarious situation. This experience was so disappointing!  I went here specifically for a customizable option, as I am on a very specific eating plan.  I didn't want to be rude, or delay the super long line even more.  I ended up paying $11 for a single entree that wasn't even close to what I asked for.  Ending on a positive note... This QDOBA is conveniently situated in a great shopping area with lots of parking.  It is clean; there are free drink refills, and an open seating floor plan.No salad without carbsUseful 24Funny 17Cool 22Business owner informationJacob L.Business Owner3/18/2019Victoria, I am sorry to hear about your last experience with QDOBA.  I am not sure what may have been the issue for the line delay, but you need a quick handed person at that station, I apologize that was not the case.  If you would like to contact jlewison@qcarolina.com we would like to offer your next meal to be on us.Read more","Business owner informationJacob L.Business Owner3/18/2019Victoria, I am sorry to hear about your last experience with QDOBA.  I am not sure what may have been the issue for the line delay, but you need a quick handed person at that station, I apologize that was not the case.  If you would like to contact jlewison@qcarolina.com we would like to offer your next meal to be on us.Read more"
"James D.Huntersville, NC012/19/2021DO NOT ORDER VIA APP OR ONLINE! The food was really good as usual but the service at this location is beyond slow and the manager, George, is NOT apologetic at all. We ordered from the app because we like to get the reward but won't be doing that again. Our order was suppose to ready at 6:29. When we walked in the employee behind the counter said it would be just a few minutes and they were working on our order. It was 25 minutes before we got our order. We watched person after person walk in after us and order and sit down to eat. When we asked the manager about our order and why were people who ordered after us in line and were served and eating after  our scheduled pick up time, we were told it was because we ordered online. He was completely unapologetic. We had already paid online or we would have left. It seems since you already had our money, you didn't care. By the way, there were a lot of DoorDash and Uber eats drivers standing there pretty upset too!UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationMatthew F.Business Customer Service2/23/2021Thank you for your feedback, James.

"Jackie M.Calgary, Canada113/22/2011First to ReviewMy 3 year old son went for his first cleaning at White Summit with Mrs. Gercio-Chad the dental hygienist.  We wanted to be sure that his first dental appointment was a good experience.  Rocell introduced herself and used a puppet to show him what they do to help keep his teeth clean.  She made him feel comfortable and he ended up really enjoying himself on his first visit!  She worked fast and  she was thorough.  For myself, she was very professional and personable.  While she was cleaning my teeth she informed me on what she was doing, which gave me confidence that she was taking good care of me.  My son and I had a great experience and we will definitely go back and recommend this clinic to friends and family.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationDavid C.Business Owner11/29/2011Thanks!

"Sarah J.Winchester, Groveport, OH019392/8/2019This restaurant had middling reviews but it was convenient to my hotel and the weather was terrible so I didn't want to drive anywhere.  It's over priced for the quality so in other words pretty typical for a hotel restaurant.I had the steak dinner which was pretty good.  I enjoyed the mushroom gravy and the steak was good if a little fatty.  The side vegetables of peppers, zucchini's, and broccoli was good.  The pasta dish side was over cooked so I should have gone with the potato option.  The beer on tap was decent but the piña colada was terrible.  A recommendation to the place: Don't make blended drinks if you can only blend the ice to quarter inch chunks.  Also they assumed for some reason that I wanted a virgin one.  I'm not sure why since I had already had a beer.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationSabrina M.Business Owner2/8/2019Thank you for your comments.

"Michael T.Elite '2021Riverside, CA232228103511/16/20192 photosMy bud and I got to town and by the time 5PM rolled around, we were pretty dang hungry. Thankfully Sean Patricks was nearby so we decided to give it a shot. Owned by Vegas giant  PT's Entertainment, Sean Patricks is truly a neighborhood bar tucked into the Southern Highlands housing area.We walked in and stood there for a sec. The interior is tastefully decorated and there are TVs everywhere with sports on all of them (yes please). There's a dining room near the bar but you have to seat yourself. At Sean Patricks the bartender doubles as your server. So after a short wait, we got menus and our drink orders in. The menu is mostly burgers, breakfast and pizzas but they have a nice appetizer selection and yes, they do serve corned beef and cabbage. I went with the drunken skins app and reuben sandwich. The food came out in a timely manner and was piping hot. The skins were great as was the Reuben. They definitely didn't skimp on the ingredients (see the pics). Thinking back, I don't know what it was with me and corned beef that night lol.Service was definitely casual so you'll get checked as fast as the bartender can get to you. There are a couple of them working so your wait shouldn't be too crazy. Oh, there is a cigar lounge on one side of the restaurant which is great. Coming from Southern California you'll never see that. Overall I had a good experience at Sean Patricks and the food was delicious. The 50% HH drinks was also helpful towards the final bill. Recommended.Reuben Sandwich with fries. Thumbs up! ($13)Drunken Skins. Corned beef & sauerkraut topped with 1000 Island. Dips were a heavy mustard and horseradish cream. Very tasty.

"Thomas R.Tucson, AZ015/1/2021We were staying rv resort in las Vegas i was having trouble with my inverter hals was recommended we made a appointment and they rescheduled and than they never showed up no phone call no reschedule very disappointingUsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationJames H.Business Owner5/3/2021Yes We had to re schedule because another job developed an issue which was unexpected and needed our attention. Had this client been the one in that seat he would have had all the attention any customer could ask for and would have been happy because his stuff was being fixed.Anyway seeing that we could not keep the scheduled appointment and thankfully we didn't have any ties other than a scheduled appointment that was yet to happen. This just has to be clarified because it did not happen like it was stated to have happened. WE DID MAINTAIN CONTACT, AND WE STILL MADE IT OUT TO THE CUSTOMER AND PERFORMED A FACTORY RESET ON THE INVERTER AT NO CHARGE AND WE DID THIS ON THE WEEKEND.So.... We did call, and we did show up, the Reset didn't fix it so they have bigger problems, Im sorry, and seeing they had to leave so soon there wasn't much we could have done beyond that anyway. So we did what we could do at that point and also proceeded to help the 4 other scheduled customers that were also affected by the set back, but thankfully they had a little more understanding.Anyway, I guess this warrants for a 1 star review.ThanksRead more","Business owner informationJames H.Business Owner5/3/2021Yes We had to re schedule because another job developed an issue which was unexpected and needed our attention.

"Darlene F.Livingston, TX01415/28/2020I find when I read these reviews, the owner always has a comeback that put the blame on the consumer, so for what its worth...get a written price. Just paid as much for them to replace canvas in our awning as a whole new awning would cost elsewhere, and charged double cuz 2 guys came, though no one told us it would. They called owner and he called basically saying we refused to pay. Not the story. Plus left everything for us to clean up and Mark's on my MH.  SAD all around. Guess I gotta spend alot of time under my 800$ canvas to get money out of it. Go elsewhere!!!Useful 4FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationJames H.Business Owner5/28/2020Customer is absolutely right, this is always the case. All I have to say is I called them to see what the problem was. I tried my best to work it out with a man that will outright call me a c*** sucker instead of listen to what I have to say. My intention was to work it out in their favor but the man was too frustrated likely with life in general more than with us considering the times. Anyway. Yes I still refunded them the difference 112$ and change, only charged them for 1.5 hours instead of the 2 it took to ensure everything was adjusted and working flawlessly. It's all to common for people to hear what they want to hear rather than what is said,, an agreement is made over the phone which we keep record of. So maybe it goes to show that they too should write down the details of the agreement at the time of scheduling so they dont forget over the course of 2+ weeks what they agreed to.I encourage them next time to take it to a shop for the same job so they can realize the value a mobile service brings to them.Read more","Business owner informationJames H.Business Owner5/28/2020Customer is absolutely right, this is always the case.

"Amy L.Marina, CA0885/7/20201 photoBeware before going to this place. They double charge travel by charging a travel fee and then labor for traveling as well. The repair person doesn't know what he doing. He set up my 6000w inverter to wires that had no business handling that kind of volume. Everything I plugged in kept tripping the circuit. $270 to do the job incorrectly. What a waste of money.Oh I guess I should continue this review, because I've been warned by this company that if I want them to fix their screw up at all, I need to remove this review or instead, they willl just call me out for being a ""liar."" They offered to refund the travel fee and then got angry and changed their minds. I'm going to report this place to the better business bureau for changing me for work not done correctly. I insist that I had arrived at our meeting place before their technician...and the reason that I think that is their technician never bothered to tell me he showed up. Not that it mattered, because he started billing labor from the second he started  driving to me (and hour and a half early.)....I feel compelled to continue my review, especially after being called a liar and a scam artist. You're right that I didn't have the parts i needed. Jim said your guy would help me get the parts because I wasn't totally sure which ones I needed. So better yet, I'm just going to attach a picture of the cable that your man was suppose to  use and a picture of the cable he actually used and let the picture speak for itself of the crappie job he did (the red wire is the correct wire, but attached is much smaller black wire). Even Jim (your employee said we needed between 8 to 10 guage wire, which is clearly not what was used). And when I told Jim what Gordy did, he said  ""ohh no"" in obvious disapproval. And the messed up thing..""James from customer relations"" (per the message on my voice-mail) aka the owner of the company, you fully recognized that Gordy screwed up too, and didn't change you tune until I decided I couldn't miss anymore of my own customer appointments waiting a whole extra day to fix his screw up.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationJames H.Business Owner5/17/2020I don't want to go into this too much because there is a LOT that went down here. for 1, we charged for work that we did, we were not able to finish the job because all the supplies were not provided to finish the job. 2nd, our Technician showed up early to the job and the technicians at Big O tires where the rig was located allowed our Technician into the vehicle because the Gal had not yet arrived.

"Steve W.Escondido, CA1311/27/2020So before you decide that Hals is who you want to have your RV fixed.....get everything in writing BEFORE you schedule an appt. Hidden costs are ""driving time, when they call you to tell you they're on their way (forget traffic congestion), a minimum of a 1 hour charge, whether they do anything or not, a $75.00 mobile fee and oh yeah, a 6% charge for credit cards...as if I carry $725.00 in cash in my pocket"".         Find someone else to do the work is my suggestion!!Useful 1Funny 2CoolBusiness owner informationJames H.Business Owner1/27/2020There are never any hidden costs, just people that decide to pay what they think they should pay, or hear what they want to hear instead of what is actually being said. Ask anyone that has worked with us, We tell every customer new or returning how we charge for the convenience we bring to you when you need a repair on your RV, and if you did any research on the company you hired, you would know that if we cannot fix it or do not do what we say we are going to do then we do not charge. Period.This customer was rude and condescending from the get go. Even before scheduling, the customer could barely make up his mind. I Told him we could replace the bent flange easily but he decided to have us come out and try and bend it back into shape, said that the part was way to expensive. I told him we could also do that but it will not be perfect because it is aluminum. He said to come out and do the best we could because he did not want to buy a (What I found out later to be a 70 dollar part). When I arrived our Tech had already done a pretty good job considering how bent this flange was, but the customer had also decided to just replace it. I asked him why he didn't just replace it to begin with? 70 bucks plus two quick cuts and its done and looks bran new. This is when he looks at me  and asks ""do you have 20 bucks? I say yes but not in cash.. then he responds if I asked you for 20 bucks would you give it to me? I responded and said yes, I would rather you ask me for it than try and take it from me.... Then he went on saying a buck is a buck and bla bla bla how every dollar adds up and how expensive it would have been bla bla bla, and all this while he has his garage door wide open showing off his Cherry Red Porche... Anyway, his cherry porche probably has nothing to do with who this guy thinks he is because what we see is yet another customer that has ripped off a company that has come out and done exactly what was understood and agreed upon at scheduling.But since he didn't like how it was looking compared to his cherry porche sitting there, and b4 the tech was even done changed his mind on what he wanted to do and that was that..  I Told the technician to collect the 1 hour minimum, as I was leaving and to not leave the bill open. I could tell this was going to go rotten as soon as I met this guy face to face. I told our technician to tell him we will pro-rate the time not used in the first hour and waive the service fee when we return to install the flange. When the tech was finished the customer disputed the bill just as expected, and told the technician that the owner is a Liar, and that he never told him how we charge or that we charge 3% (Not 6%) for Credit card processing. When the reality is this company holds strict to its policies, and disclosing to every customer how we charge is one of them, weather new or returning. So, Sir we have Many Many Many returning customers who know and appreciate the value we Litterally bring to them with our thorough understanding of how to take care of their investment, and you sir will no longer be able to benefit from that care and understanding, because Happy Hals does not need your business But if ever I see you begging for a buck, I'll give you 20.Read more","Business owner informationJames H.Business Owner1/27/2020There are never any hidden costs, just people that decide to pay what they think they should pay, or hear what they want to hear instead of what is actually being said.

"Momo B.Paradise, NV2228294535/1/202032 photosITS NOT AS ENJOYABLE ANYMOREI've been here long enough to remember LAS having just one Chinese supermarket. Now there's four of them. 168 Market is definitely my favorite.  In case you didn't know, 168 is owned by Taiwanese Tawa Supermarket which also owns 99 Ranch Markets. With exception, Tawa Supermarket does not own the two 99 Ranch stores in LAS. They are franchises owned by a nephew of Tawa. That may explain why I don't care to shop at either stores.  The overall quality in shopping experience is substantially inferior compared to corporate owned stores.There are five other 168's in California. Haven't been to any other 168 store to compare in terms of inventory, cleanliness and service.Currently, customers must wear a face cover while in the store. Social distancing is implied while waiting for a sanitized shopping cart. There's a 20 minutes wait outside before entering store.  Unfortunately zero social distancing in the produce section. Deli and bakery were open, but no seating except for store employees.See all photos from Momo B. for 168 MarketUseful 19Funny 8Cool 13Business owner informationCustomer ServiceBusiness Customer Service5/4/2020Hello Momo, Thank you for your review and feedback!

It is stressful to see employees at grocery stores wearing no masks and gloves while stocking fresh products.I was craving for asian food and in need to purchase ingredients, I came to 168 and saw an employee at the entrance doing the headcount and telling people to put their masks on before entering, and there was another employee disinfecting shopping carts on the side. Once I walked in, I saw every worker wearing masks and eye protections.I felt safe to shop in 168 and I've told my friends about it. Thank you for the safety and the sanitizing efforts.

First of all there is limited or no sanitizing station at all. Also I noticed they do not sanitize or clean carts upon each use. Unlike any other stores they clean between each use and sanitizing station everywhere. During this time especialy Covid-19 is spreading fast and vaccine is right around the corner, we should keep in mind still be very careful. I just find this supermarket not following covid mandated regulations. I appreciate that staff wears PPE to protect themselves and otherw, but extra precautions should be consider.

"Cleeii A.Elite '2021Las Vegas, NV53163146510/2/201913 photosThis review is for their deli section. Everything was good, lots of entree choices, huge portions and very affordable. They offer plate lunches styles like Panda Express. One, two, or three item combo prices ranges only $5.29-7.99 with free egg soup. It gets a little busy(especially on weekends) so be sure to grab a number by their roast pork/duck display. They have a dimsum station with plenty of selections and good for a quick fix. Chicken feet in black bean sauce tastes great though. I do love their pastries in the bakery. They have varieties of bread, cakes, etc with the same concept at 85C bakery. Coffee buns and mini hotdog bread are my favorite. You can get a milk tea, iced/hot tea, or coffee for only 99c with pastry purchase. Vietnamese coffee is $1.99.

"Apple S.Elite '2021Denver, CO6332272256559/26/20184 photosThe spa section is on the second floor. There's several stores and the gym is huge. If you pay the resort fee of $40 then it's free to use otherwise $15. I love how large the gym is and amount of equipment. It gets busy in the morning. Staff is friendly. Free water and fruits provided. Free to use towels and headphones. Big issue: freezing cold: I started coming with a sweater on! And others were complaining too. I know it's a gym but it is just too cold. Another issue is: I'm working out, running around spraying Febreze around in the air which I'm now heavily inhaling is just disgusting. I have life long issues with sinuses and I had to leave on the third day as the air circulation was so painful.

"Lisa S.Las Vegas, NV02033/17/2021Wow! I would highly recommend this company to drain and deep clean your pool. Our tile was cleaned to perfection. The tile is 10 years old, yet after sand blasting all of the hard water stains over the years it looks like brand new tile. I thought for sure they were not going to be able to get most of it, but they got every bit of it. If you are experiencing algae every summer and can't get rid of it, deep cleaning your pool is probably what it needs.

"Mel U.Elite '2021San Jose, CA42630412014/29/20192 photosThis was the first poke place I have tried in Vegas, and I will say it already set the bar really high. I have tried several poke places in the Bay Area, and you would think most of those places would have excellent poke. Honestly, there was only ONE poke place out there that I loved. I will say Poke Addiction is almost on par with that place that I love AND is better than be other places that I have tried out there. The inside is very cozy and small, but I was ordering my bowl to go anyways so that didn't matter. I customized by own bowl with 4 proteins: 2 salmon, scallops and surimi crab. This place has many toppings and sauces to choose from as well, so I really enjoyed that. It was only $11.99 for a large bowl, which I am happy about because large bowls in the Bay Area would be around $15. The protein to me tasted incredibly good. The scallops were sweet and the salmon was so tender. I loved the crab as well! The only reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars is because I think I like the sauces better at my favorite place. The sauces I got here were good, but not fantastic to me. Overall, I'm sure I will be coming back here. Great poke at great prices.Salmon, scallops and surimi crab with jalapeños, mango, green onion and corn. Spicy mayo drizzle on top.Useful 6Funny 2Cool 4Business owner informationP.

"Erika N.Elite '2021Las Vegas, NV68371216161/2/20181 photoI really wanted to like this place since it's the closest poke spot to my house, but it was just ok. To start I was really turned off with the fact that they offer 25% off for ""instant reviews"" aka false positive reviews in order to save money. If the place is good, it's good, without needing to incentivize reviewers. I ended up ordering the Lust bowl. I did appreciate the choice between white or brown rice and how friendly the staff member was who helped me was. The fish and shrimp were good and fresh, but the rest was kinda meh. Way too much rice and not enough meat & also it was super dry. I needed to put two packets of soy sauce on it to make it taste better.

"Gene B.Elite '2021Queen Creek, AZ383882439/16/2018I went here based off the Yelp! reviews and will say that they were mostly accurate, the food and the bad. This place definitely doesn't have a ""Chain restaurant"" feel, which in this case is both good and bad. Portions were small in my opinion compared to other locations, specifically the salad amount even though I got a large. I was happy with the protein portion, wasn't huge but definitely on par. (I travel for work so am comparing to not only Vegas area but also Phoenix and LA Poke restaurants as well.)Service was not as polished as most chain places either, like Poke Poku. Not unprofessional, just more casual and not polished. More of the the ""just hanging out"" kind of attitude. I didn't mind but I noticed. Also the lack of tea to drink meant I had to pay $2.95 for a bottle of Smart Water - ouch! I don't drink soda so yeah. Adding some standard drip black tea (not powder or instant) would be a big improvement, at least for me.The Yelp! cash back, Check-In discount, location and seemingly honest reviews are what brought me in, and they were all spot on.Long story short, I would definitely come back here but only if I was nearby and was craving poke. A good chain brand nearby would unfortunately get my business, at least unless this place improved.This isn't meant to be a dig, just an honest review. Btw I went 3 stars instead of 2 because of the cash back and check-in offer.Cheers!Useful 5FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationP.

The burrito wasn't as stuffed as SOHO sushi burrito. Flavor was good, fish was good. Sis liked her bowl. Even though the burrito wasn't as filled as SOHO, I was still super full.They have fountain drinks available and canned drinks. They also have specialty drinks, I briefly  saw watermelon? They also have ice cream options for dessert.I was there mainly for their sushi burrito so I wasn't paying much attention to the other stuff on the menu.

I heard it opened up not too long ago and knowing that I loved sushi and sushi burritos I had to go try it out. Walking in, the place itself is very small but is very clean. It's not loud and it wasn't busy when I came. The lady that helped me didn't really know what she was doing because I had to keep reminding her what to put on my burrito but she was kind. I payed around $12 for a very tiny rolled burrito that I honestly don't think was worth the price. I asked for scallops and crab and in other sushi places they gave me a very good amount that made a good sized burrito, but in this burrito I had a total of only 5 scallops and two teaspoons of crab meat. Here the burrito was extremely thin and the seaweed paper almost felt like cardboard and was very hard to chew on. I know this place is new that why I'm hoping they correct their mistakes and better their service.Read more","Business owner informationP.

I got 5 small, raw, cold pieces of plain tofu, warm raw cabbage, little to no rice. Without asking for extra sauce on the side, I would have been eating all this dry.

My father has been my mechanic since I began driving, and we have a trusted shop back in Massachusetts that we use for any requirements that he can't complete from our driveway. Upon moving out here, 600 miles from home, I was nervous to enter a repair shop as a young woman and have my car both diagnosed and repaired, having heard horror stories from my father of dishonest shop owners.After a poor experience with Conrad's, I called other mechanics in the area, Midas being the first. Anthony, the manager, diagnosed my vehicle within 30 minutes of my call and planned for a full clutch replacement. I mentioned I needed an oil change and he threw it in for free.

My craving was for a new sandwich joint with something different than the 'ole Subway. BTW I hate Subway. It sucks. Horrible bread and the smell alone makes me think I'm eating at the local Walmart. Couple that with the perv Jared who lived 20 min from my home in northern Indianapolis. I digress, yes. Overall, my hot turkey was loaded with all the fixens. There was a pretty good balance of toasted bread to ingredients ratio. However, it did have a hard time holding up as I ate it.  You know that experience when the goods start slipping out of the bread as you eat it? Yeah that's the one.

"Sam T.Phoenix, AZ612110/9/2020I placed an order on their website, and received a call from  Firehouse subs just a couple minutes later, Figuring they were Calling me to tell me that my order could be made or maybe they were closing early I was surprised to find that been reached out to me,  To question a mistake on the order I had ordered a sub with everything including banana peppers the ticket he got read a sub with nothing including the meat add banana peppers. Being extremely thankful for his call as I would not have noticed until I got back to the house. I want to make sure that people know firehouse in all the tuki goes above and beyond.

"Xavier R.Phoenix, AZ63141111/5/2019This place sucks. Let me start by saying they were nasty because I forgot to say to make my sub cold even after I apologized. Then the minimal intelligence level led them to still get everyone in my party order wrong.Then they purposefully added what they wanted cause they got mad even after I requested all the regular things not be added.Horrible attitude I went around 830pm on 11/4/ 19 so they were two guys there .

"Leah L.Phoenix, AZ22651/12/2021I ordered a couple sandwiches and one was made correctly and the other was not.  I completed the survey without any expectations of a response. Within a couple hours,   I received a call from the General Manager Shamichael, to discuss my survey feedback. She was very caring and professional and generously offered to replace both sandwiches.   Since I was not able to revisit the same day,  she kindly accommodated for the sandwiches to be available on a follow up visit. I appreciate the replacements but what stands out is her outstanding care for the customers and customer satisfaction. She is a real asset to the restaurant and has definitely procured a loyal and repeat customer in me.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationGuest Services at Firehouse SubsBusiness Manager1/14/2021Thank you so much, Leah, for visiting with us and sharing your awesome feedback.

"Michael D.Queen Creek, AZ0552/22/2020Haven't been to firehouse subs in awhile. Cashier was tentative and even instructed the line workers to please put the bbq sauce on the side for the smokehouse beef and brisket sandwich (which they did). Reason I'm giving the 3 stars out of 5 is because of the packaging. Instead of rolling the sandwiches in deli paper and taping them they now put them in a cardboard container with a sliver of paper which I assume is to stop the grease from getting through the cardboard box. Sure cardboard box, kind of whatever right? Wrong. In a matter of seconds of placing it on the counter my child grabbed it and knocked it on the floor exploding my sandwich across the kitchen floor. Is this partly my fault? Sure! However, if they would have just kept to original wrapping paper instead of cutting corners I'd be eating a sandwich right now. Instead I sit frustrated watching my family eat their food while I contemplate going to another restaurant or take on the daunting task of cooking a meal on a lazy rainy day.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationGuest Services at Firehouse SubsBusiness Manager2/25/2020Michael, thank you for taking the time to share your concerns with us.

"Brittany H.Cleveland, OH042/18/2021Lindsay and the entire Elle Kaye Group made the home selling process an absolute joy! Lindsay is super knowledgeable on the selling process, what to expect from listing to showings to contingency, and what was fair in terms of pricing. Our listing photos, video, and marketing was top notch. She personally explained prospective buyer feedback in a way that helped us understand where our listing stood. When an offer was made on our home, Lindsay went above and beyond - we were absolutely blown away with how her expertise and confidence got us the best outcome. Further, Lindsay and her team were always there for communication and quick questions (even during the busy holiday season!). I can truly say that Lindsay and her team will be friends in the future and we can't wait to refer her and the team to any friends/family looking to buy or sell in the Northeast Ohio region!Useful 1Funny 1Cool 1Business owner informationLindsay K.Business Owner3/4/2021Thank you for the kind words, Brittany!

"Amy B.San Diego, CA021/18/2021My husband and I are new to the area and decided to buy our first home, so things could have gone really badly. But they didn't, because Lindsay was our realtor. She was really helpful at the beginning of our search as we were thinking through our priorities. She helped us figure out what was feasible in the neighborhoods we were looking in. She was always available for walkthroughs and got us some of the very first showings of houses we liked. When we found the house we wanted to make an offer on, Lindsay guided us through how to do it--and we got the house! Lindsay was very personable and easy to work with, and her staff were very helpful and professional. We'd recommend Lindsay to anyone looking to buy in the area.Useful 1Funny 1Cool 1Business owner informationLindsay K.Business Owner3/4/2021Thank you, Amy! It was so great working with you and Matt.

"Shondra K.Columbus, OH837/20/2020Working with Lindsay was a breeze. She is very well-versed in the areas I was interested in. So much so that she suggested a lesser-known (to me) nook in which she was working as the listing agent for repeat clients (sellers) of hers that she thought I may have an interest in. Well, she was right - it was the first and only home I looked at. The sellers were wonderful to work with, as well, & Lindsay did an excellent job working as a dual agent without me feeling like her loyalty was with one side versus another. I'd highly recommend her to anyone looking in the greater Cleveland/northeast Ohio area.Useful 1Funny 1Cool 1Business owner informationLindsay K.Business Owner7/25/2020Shondra, I am so glad we were able to make this match!

"Samantha M.Cleveland Heights, OH463821646/4/20203 photosMy fiance and I are simply blown away by Lindsay Kronk of the Elle Kay Group! We are both first-time home buyers and admittedly we didn't know much (okay, really anything) about the home buying process, but we knew that we needed to find someone reputable, smart, thoughtful, professional and thorough to help us buy our dream home in our new state of Ohio! I actually found Lindsay through Yelp and read through the reviews and knew in a heart beat she was our girl! We didn't even interview other agents...we just knew she would hustle for us as we were navigating our move from Maine to Ohio for my fiance's residency at the Clinic. Wow, we're we right. We virtually toured about 10 houses before laying our eyes on our new home and she walked us through the entire process from start to finish in an encouraging and intelligent way. With her guidance, we put in a strong offer and three hours later we had our offer accepted by the seller. Fast forward to 6 weeks later, we were handed the keys to our first home. Was the process a little stressful? Of course - we were buying a home! BUT she made the whole thing way easier with texts and calls to walk us through what was needed and when. Thank you times a million to Lindsay for helping us find our home and being such a professional throughout the entire process. Me, my fiance and our dog Chubbs LOVE the Cleveland area and love our home even more.Useful 1FunnyCool 1Business owner informationLindsay K.Business Owner6/11/2020Samantha, thank you so much for your glowing review!

"Luciana S.Elite '2021Cleveland, OH2391214156/17/2019Being a first time home buyer in a new state is daunting; especially in a spring seller's market. Lindsay is the agent you want to work with if you want a person who can be adaptive, an advocate for you, and quick to respond to your questions and concerns. Lindsay explained, sometimes multiple times, anything I didn't fully understand. It was refreshing to have an agent who was respectful of my concerns and provided her perspective as a homeowner. Lindsay made the home buying process easy and efficient. Lindsay worked extremely well with my loan officer and was in constant communication with both my loan officer and I whenever an issue or question came up. This professional relationship and my preparation before buying the home allowed me to close 18 days earlier that the suggested close date; making my home buying process only 28 days long -- from offer acceptance by seller to close with keys in hand! Lindsay was always reachable by text, call or email and facilitated the signing processes by utilizing DocuSign. If you are looking for a real estate agent in Ohio, stop looking and contact Lindsay Kronk.Useful 1FunnyCool 1Business owner informationLindsay K.Business Owner9/3/2019Thank you for the comments, Luciana!

"Gina R.Penfield, NY052/3/2020I'm new in the area and love doing hot yoga back in NY where I'm from. Now first I would like to note that while both are hot yoga, this was Bikrahm while the one at home had the vinyasa flow (I'm not exactly sure of the correct name). So the practice is a bit different. The positives were that the room was very hot which I like and the ""workout"" was challenging enough. The room I suppose could have been cleaner like some comments suggest but I wasn't bothered too much by it. Since I'm new to the city, I've never taken a class there and the instructors were indeed made aware of that. Usually I would think they would give me a bit of a heads up if there was any rules or at least let me know more about what their studio entails/what they're about. Again not bothered, I have done yoga before at a few different studios (didn't think much would differ between them). However, with these positives noted, there were some things I found unpleasant and are the reasons I will not be returning. No matter the type of yoga, I believe that the main purpose of it is to find peace and relaxation and focus on breath. You do what is right for your body and mind and do modifications if needed, or rest if needed. The instructor is mearly a guide not a rule. This philosophy I have seen at almost all yoga studios prior, but was not followed at this studio (which is completely fine if that is not what you're looking for!) The instructor was correcting people the entire time and calling people out if they did a pose well or if they did bad. I understand this is how people ""learn"" however it wasn't taken into account that everyone is on their own journey or level of fitness/flexibility. It also greatly hindered the relaxation and focus aspect of yoga. It almost felt like a competitive environment which is not what I personally want during a yoga session. Now I have bad hips and often need to pop them back into alignment. I'm pretty flexible so I often just do this by sitting in a split to realign one side. This is what I chose to do as a modification instead of a different pose that 1. Was uncomfortable on my hip and 2. Not challenging for me at all flexibility wise. So my modification was to do what my body needed more (both were similar sitting down poses). The instructors called me out by name and yelled at me as if she was a teacher in a kindergarten class. I was so in shock. Never in all the yoga sessions I have gone to has this ever happened. She was snarky and rude to put it frankly, especially to someone who just has taken their first class at this studio. If people are not allowed to do modifications or a different pose that feels right for them that should have been addressed to me either before the class or even after. Like I said before, to me that's not what yoga is about. It's about doing what feels right in the moment and what your body needs, etc. However, to call out someone in such a manner during a class I found out of line and extremely unnecessary/immature. Both women who were there at the time did not seem very friendly or welcoming. If you're looking for a good workout and to sweat, sure this may be the right choice for you! However if you're looking for a more yoga and relaxing experience I can't say I recommended this location.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationZeb H.Business Owner2/4/2020Hi Gina,I'm sorry to hear you had a less than ideal experience at our studio.

I just wanted to post here in the hopes you see it and I can help sort out any confusion/concerns about our selection and pricing etc.Around the time of your review we were short on a bunch of produce due to the massive frosts that had affected numerous crops from Vancouver all the way down to southern Mexico(where it got down to -6 C for several nights wiping out up to 80% of certain crops like lettuce in areas) so I am sorry for that. Crops have recovered well and we have a large order of organic produce that just came in last week with some great stuff like romanesco, garnet yams, fresh carrots with the tops on etc...  We try to be very competitive on price with other stores and are less expensive than many. Come this spring when we have access to local pesticide free crops from smaller farms again our prices and selection of quality local produce will be hard to beat downtown. I just got a call the other day from Broxburn farms in Lethbridge and they will have tomatoes and peppers ready for harvest again before the end of March which is exciting news.As for our breads the most expensive loaf we carry is the veggie/cheese topped focaccia from Sidewalk Citizen which is $6.75 so I am not sure what you saw that was marked $12.00, if there was something it was certainly a mistake in labeling.We're a small independent grocer still getting up off the ground and our selection grows a little every week as we get busier so please be sure to stop in again sometime and take a look around.

I just got a call the other day from Broxburn farms in Lethbridge and they will have tomatoes and peppers ready for harvest again before the end of March which is exciting news.As for our breads the most expensive loaf we carry is the veggie/cheese topped focaccia from Sidewalk Citizen which is $6.75 so I am not sure what you saw that was marked $12.00, if there was something it was certainly a mistake in labeling.We're a small independent grocer still getting up off the ground and our selection grows a little every week as we get busier so please be sure to stop in again sometime and take a look around. Just this past week we started carrying a delicious selection of gelatto and sorbetto Fiasco Gelato made right here in Calgary.Your feedback is appreciated and please let me know if you have any questions or additional comments that would help to make us better.Thank you,Evan - Old School EmporiumRead more"
"Priscila M.Las Vegas, NV212841456/6/20183 photosAbsolutely love their swimsuits! They're cute, comfortable and very affordable.I was surprise with how many styles and colors they have available when I walked into their little store. Sheyanne and Chris are super friendly and attentive, she showed me the CUTEST monokini I've ever seen and also the bikini bottom I was interested on in a ton of different colors and two different sizes, Chris was super helpful finding me the perfect top to match that one bottom.They do run a little small, I normally wear Small but all my pieces from them are a Medium. They all feel comfortable and I like how their material is a good quality one - for their low prices I expected less.I totally recommend checking them out, they have swimsuits to please everyone!Useful 2FunnyCool 1Business owner informationSheyanne M.Business Owner2/16/2019Thank you for the feedback and wonderful pics!

"Terence C.Toronto, Canada029/21/2019I rarely post reviews but my first visit today (also my last) to Liberty Massage Boutique was just so bad that I need to share it here.They called me yesterday evening to switch the therapist in order to help with their scheduling. That was fine so I confirmed my appointment at 10am.Today I showed up on time but the door was locked and no one was answering my calls. Finally someone showed up at 10:20am, she happened to be my therapist Julia. Unfortunately she didn't have key to get in either. We waited for another 5 min, the receptionist finally showed up from his breakfast break and let me in. That's when I checked my email and saw a couple emails received at 7:51am, 8:19am and 8:20am from Katherine DiPasquale, their Director of Operations. Basically she was informing me that her therapists could not show up on time and changed my appointment time to 4pm without my confirmation/ acknowledgement.Until now, I have not received an official apology from Katherine for last minute rescheduling my appointment. I would not recommend anyone to go if you don't want your Saturday morning ruined like mine.Useful 3Funny 1CoolBusiness owner informationManagement T.Business Owner9/23/2019Terence,It's unfortunate that you did not enjoy your first experience at Liberty Massage Boutique. A number of scheduling issues took place this weekend which were extraordinary - several of our therapists came down with a bug within a 48 hour time span and many appointments had to be rescheduled at the last minute. Due to the high volume of schedule changes, a mistake was made whereby the receptionist thought your appointment was confirmed to be postponed and thought it would be opportune to use this window of time to run errands. This was not the case and resulted in your treatment being delayed.  For this our team has sincerely apologized several times, from the receptionist, the therapist (who mustered the energy to come in for your treatment since it was not confirmed to be postponed), and management. A discount was also extended, which you accepted, for your inconvenience. We continue to strive to provide high quality massage therapy treatments and feel grateful to work in a such an understanding community.

The price has been very reasonable for monthly service and when I've had issues in the past Jason has tried his best to remedy them and I appreciate his help. They keep you updated as much as they can and the service is pretty reliable, obviously barring freakishly strong winds here in Henderson.

"Basil K.Las Vegas, NV438357/2/20181 photoGood service, BUT I'm seriously annoyed that after years there wanting to raise my monthly charge by $20. I was previously getting serviced through Desert Springs Pools and Spas who built our pool and Beat The Heat purchased their clients (in 2017) and are NOW notifying clients of the increase in service even though they sent out emails initially that everything would remain the same (email from 2017).Again, the service is GOOD but there is no way I'm paying $20 for my small pool and spa to be serviced. I'm stopping service next month (when the increase takes effect) and currently searching  for another company in hopes that they'd stick to there quoted and accepted service charges. There is no way in 1 year that gasoline and pool chemical prices sky rocketed to cause a $20 increase in my service. I appreciate the service.

"Detert D.Peoria, AZ025/31/2014I don't give 5 Stars to any auto repair shop unless I'm able to compare prices, work, etc., but I have no complaints with the work that was done or how I was treated at the Peoria AAA shop. Devin was very friendly and professional. While the bill wasn't pleasant, that's not their fault. They gave me a list of things that needed fixed and didn't complain or try to persuade me to repair some things I felt could wait, especially since we will be replacing the van at the end of the year when the 2015 Prius is released.Anyway, I needed the AC fixed. The hoses were leaking and the compressor needed to be replaced, not unexpected for a 15-yr old vehicle. They also found a leaking axle seal and both the oil pan and transmission pan gaskets were leaking. Since we have two cross-country trips of 6,000 and 12,000 miles coming up, I decided to fix the AC & axle and hold off on the gaskets. Devin did not try to talk me out of that decision when I asked how serious the gasket problem was. He agreed it wasn't a safety concern as long as I kept an eye on fluid levels, which I do. I should note that I change my own oil at times, so I know they've been leaking and I wasn't being taken advantage of. I also know about what AC repairs cost, so I felt their prices were in line with what I expected.I was a walk-in, so they were only able to finish the diagnostics that day, but they completed the work on time the next day and for the price quoted. They even kept the van an extra day because I ended up in the ER that morning and didn't get released until after they closed. I don't know if I could have paid less elsewhere or even if the repairs were needed, but I had no reason not to trust what they told me and it wasn't worth it to me to go price-shopping to save a few dollars. Besides, based on my experience with several repair shops around the country, the AAA warranty is pretty hard to beat, especially since it includes labor. Of course, they're betting the parts won't break and I'm hoping they don't. :)Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationValerie S.Business Manager5/31/2014So glad you got the service you hoped for and the the work you expected.

"Gayle K.San Francisco, CA027/29/2018I took my car in because when braking moderately, infrequently it would pull toward the left and made a screeching sound.  Devin kept saying squeaking, but I reiterated a screech.  Intermittently the pedal went further down than I thought it should so I pumped it.  That part was easier to deal with.  I did test my brakes in a vacant area using pressure and they stopped fine.  I just didn't like the occasional sound and feeling like I am going sideways.BTW, even on the internet I found other Toyota owners complaining about intermittent issues.Devin admitted on they didn't experience the pull.  Nonetheless, I paid some $500 for rear brakes to be taken care of.  I no more than left the shop and it pulled to the left.  The pedal continued to go too far.Came back and they had my car for the day again.  Devin said they rechecked their work and everything was done properly.  I didn't come in for proper work...I came in for proper work to fix stated problem!However, Devin was nice enough to offer to do the front brakes for some $300 if the sound bugged me so much I couldn't live with it.With a AAA approved shop, you have somewhere to file a complaint.  But when it is AAA themself.......Useful 2FunnyCool 1Business owner informationValerie S.Business Manager8/30/2018We are very sorry to hear about this experience, Gayle.

"Stacy Z.Glendale, AZ29300294/20/2013""Well, AAA has never steered us wrong, let's give it a shot"". Famous last words. Never again. We have been AAA members since 2006 and my parents have been AAA members for many more years. Partway through this experience I was very close to canceling my AAA membership altogether.You can read my husband Chris's review to get some of the details- I won't repeat them here. To be fair, the manager of the shop did call after I filed a complaint with AAA corporate. He talked with me to try and make things right. They offered us a refund on the radiator cap (which they found sitting in the shop), and on the labor cost of getting the radiator fans replaced. The additional star is mainly because the manager called to talk with me. I still think they let us take the car the first time without adequately checking to make sure it was fixed, but that is a matter of opinion. Do I think they were trying to rip us off? No, probably not. The prices were fair and the warranty was decent. Would I come back? No, probably not.Useful 7FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationValerie S.Business Manager4/22/2013Stacy, thank you for allowing us to resolve your issue in a prompt and acceptable manner.

Unfortunately, hard working individuals like those of us at Dana Realty Group are effected negatively in our ratings with bogus reviews like this one.Read more"

"Jessica M.Los Angeles, CA111637/6/2018Canceled a lawn service twice 'due to weather'.

"Nancy S.Elite '2021Eloy, AZ2343821672/21/2021It's been a while since I had been to a Red Lobster. How I missed those cheddar biscuits!  My sisters were craving shrimp, so they were delighted to have options.  It's always risky for me to go to a seafood restaurant - I'm deathly allergic to shellfish. But I love how their staff will take care of me once I let them know of my allergy, so I feel very safe here.  I had planned on getting my usual fish and chips, but my eye was drawn to their Cajun Chicken Alfredo.  Was I glad I did. Super yummy and super big.  Half went home for tomorrow's lunch!  Served with your choices of sides. The new Kale salad is super good - a big hit with all - even my niece who usually has Ranch on everything! I also enjoyed their lemonade. And my sisters all got their share of shrimp! Excellent service - good food. Tada!Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationAngelleca H.Business Customer Service2/25/2021Nancy - We're really happy to know you had a fantastic experience!

I received 2 Walt's Favorite Shrimp ""COMBINATION""'s, a super small salad I didn't order, a small cup with ""TWO CROUTONS"" with no dressing and two baked potatoes.I spoke with Jenny, the Manager, and she was only willing to compensate for 1 combination and 1 scallops order. I explained we threw the scallops away because that's not our preference. It didn't matter so all I could say was okay.  To add insult to injury, I used a gift card and credit card. I'll certainly notify the person that gave us the gift card so they don't purchase anymore.

"Simon W.Elite '2021Scottsdale, AZ9812164168/13/20183 photosCame here Saturday to get some food because I was craving for some Panda, but guess what? They weren't even open yet, as they should had been.  They weren't even close to being open too.  It was 10:15am and they are barely starting to cook.  They are suppose to be opened at 10:00am sharp!  Not 10:30am.  A few customers ask if they will be opening soon and the cashier would rudely babble something like we don't know... the hell were they doing? Party too hard last night and all the staff overslept!? Hope you guys know you're not a small ma and pa joint, you're a dang chain! Big chain!  Service is always slow, always long lines, the older lady is always grumpy, but the younger one is pretty nice.  The food is the same as any Panda, I ordered the Panda bowl, with rice and Orange Chicken.  Smells good and tasted great.  Got a small drink too.  Came up to be $9.00. However the Orange Chicken was mainly breading, every once in a while I'll get lucky and taste some chicken.  This is no Orange Chicken! More like Orange Breading.  $9.00 for no Chicken, and sugary bread this is highway robbery!Overall a not so good experience from a not so great Panda.  I recommend you avoid this place like the small pox.  2 stars for you guys and I'm being super friendly here.Useful 108Funny 49Cool 71Business owner informationFlora W.Business Customer Service8/16/2018Hi Simon.

"Jim C.Glendale, AZ0289/9/2020Our cashier made our experience really unpleasant. She was a bit rude by rushing us. There weren't a lot of people behind either. Maybe two people. According the the receipt it says rose. She took cash and change from the previous customer and then proceeded to handle our food . I felt pretty uneasy about eating it after. She the turned on the water behind her after serving us and let the water run. No scrubbing or changing gloves. They had social distance signs but there was no enforcing.

"Emila M.Blythe, CA0222/2/20202 photosI only come here because it's the most convenient fast food place in this mall, as I'm sure most people do. There is a downside to this location, the line here is always more than atleast 10 people long, which is highly inconvenient when the workers can be extremely slow and occasionally dont even know what they're doing. The main reason I'm giving this location two stars is because they NEVER have any super greens, and it takes more than 5 minutes to make.

"Sheila G.Elite '2021Las Vegas, NV56379015042/16/20192 photosWas happy to find a new place to take out dinner relatively close to home. My husband went to pick up our order - we each got the half rotisserie chicken.The chicken was very good, though nothing spectacular. I enjoyed the mutabbal, which is much like babaganoush, and the fatoush salad. The rice was different, but tasty. But I thought the Toom sauce was weird, more like garlicky whipped butter. I have no clue why it's considered sauce. Worst of all was the pita: it came wrapped in foil, but was cold from the trip home. I put it into the toaster oven (without foil), and before the oven could even warm up, the pita puffed up and got hard. Instant very thin pita chips, and tasteless ones at that. Having read reviews on Yelp about the restaurant's fall-apart wraps, I told hubby to not order one of them. So he had a brain fart, didn't order a sandwich, but bought a whole bag of their awful pita.While our dinner was okay overall, I'm not sure we'll try it again. If I feel like wrestling a whole, much bigger rotisserie chicken, I may get it from Costco, along with some hummus from TJ's.Roast Chicken PlatterUseful 10FunnyCool 4Business owner informationGina V.Business Owner2/22/2019Thank you for your candid feedback. We're sorry to hear that the pita wasn't to your liking. We actually bake our own pita fresh, daily, where it should be soft to the touch and balanced on the palate - it's a traditional recipe with the thickness in mind as we aim for it to have subtle flavor as the stars should be the items you cradle in the pita such as the Mutabbal and Hummus, or our rotisserie chicken with some of the Toom.

"Inga B.Mesa, AZ07127/8/2019The only reason I gave them 1 star is because you can't write a review with -0- stars. Looks can be deceiving! You think you are entering into a contract with an ethical, locally owned family business. They may be locally owned and it may be a family business but they are all about the dollar, keeping yours no matter the reason. My son and his fiancee contracted with them in June of 2018 for June of 2019 date. In January our brides mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 Ovarian Cancer. Her doctors told the family if we wanted the brides mother in attendance, we need to move the date up the sooner the better. The church moved things around and graciously gave a date within 30 days. Ashley Castle could not accommodate that date, so we respectfully requested a partial refund, given the fact that they had 5 months to rebook that date. We didn't even receive the favor of a reply, which in my mind is so disrespectful. Yes we understand we signed a contract. A contract I would think isdesigned to protect Ashley Castle from young couples who break up orelope or for whatever reason just plain change their minds and decide not to get married on the date they have contracted with you.We did not change our minds, we did not break up, we did not elope. Wehad life throw us a curve ball that we never saw coming. We were not atrisk of losing a 2nd cousin or an aunt or uncle from attending our wedding, we were at risk of losing the Mother of the Bride. Which in our minds, and hopefully yours as well, would have been just plain unacceptable.We were willing to concede $ 571.00 of the $1571.00 we paid on or about June 14, 2018 as compensation for the 2 tasting dinners we attended and any other cancellation fee which might be assessed. However the remaining $1000 plus $2500.00 that was paid by the Brides Father, we respectfully requested be refunded to us. The contract states that if we had missed the $2500.00 payment you would have been within your rights to cancel our contract for non payment. So if the Brides Mother had been diagnosed on December 15th instead of January 15th we would not have lost that $2500.00? The $3500.00 we respectfully requested be refunded would have gone a long way towards all of the medical bills that are piling up.A big part of the appeal of Ashley Castle is that you are a locally ownedfamily business, not a heartless national chain. I would think if anycircumstance would merit your compassion to a family already dealingwith a very uncertain future, it would be this one.Our Bride wanted nothing more than to be one of those Brides that haswritten a glowing review on your testimonial page. She grew up wantingthe Fairy Tale Wedding that would have been completed with a receptionat Ashley Castle. One of the video's on your Facebook page touts ""A Fairytale Beginning to your Happily Ever After"" but without Kristens mother in attendance it would have been more of a nightmare.Not only did our family not receive one dime back from Ashley Castle we never even received the courtesy of a reply to our request for consideration. Do yourself a favor and SKIP The Ashley Castle they only care about your wallet not your family or your big day.Useful 6FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationThe Ashley C.Business Manager7/12/2019We are disheartened by this review. The Ashley Castle was notified 4 months prior to Kristen's wedding date, of her mother's illness. We greatly sympathized with her concern on waiting to have their wedding and went above and beyond to try to accommodate her and her groom. They both expressed an interest in pushing up the date here at the Castle. We met with them immediately to brainstorm a solution.We offered earlier dates and were willing to waive any rescheduling fees, they denied. Additionally, we offered different packages to reduce the expense, they denied. We tried everything in our power to help them in this time of need. Cancer is something we are all unfortunately affected by in one way or another, and we have the deepest compassion for this bride's situation. Contractually, we are not obligated to offer or do any of these things. When a bride and groom put money down on a date we no longer sell that date. Furthermore, we were unable to re-book this date after the cancellation so we too were negatively affected. As stated in line 3 of the contract Kristen signed;""In the event the RENTER cancels, the deposit payment, along with any payments made as of the date of cancellation WILL NOT BE REFUNDED.""The bride made the required contracted payments to our company, the deposit and midpoint payments totaling $4,071.00. We wish it could have worked out for all and hope for the best outcome for Kristen and her family.Read more","Business owner informationThe Ashley C.Business Manager7/12/2019We are disheartened by this review.

"Kevin K.Las Vegas, NV01931/21/2015My experience with this gallery, specifically their GM George Booth, was completely miserable to say the least.  I first came upon this place Labor Day weekend of 2014 to attend an event with an alternative model I follow online hosting and her artist friend whose art was on display there, both of them visiting from out of town.  I placed an order with George for a canvas piece by the visiting artist with the model in it since the size I wanted was not available in store.  Then I waited patiently two months for this piece to show up with no word from the gallery as to what the status of my order was.  I finally called them to check up on it and was told there was an issue with the publisher but they were working on making it happen still.  I waited another month and a half, AGAIN with nobody contacting me to let me know where my order stood.  I called a second time to be told the co-owner and publisher had a falling out and it would no longer be possible for the gallery to fill my order so the only thing left was to get my refund.  Easy enough, right?  WRONG!   We established the week before Christmas a refund check would be issued and sent to me in the mail.  After the holidays came and went and I hadn't received my check I followed up again with an e-mail indicating that, after nearly four and half months since first placing this order, my patience on the matter was fading fast and could I PLEASE get the refund I was promised?  I received a response from George indicating he'd forgotten to send it but would mail it out the next day.  That same night I reconnected with the model for the first time since seeing her at the gallery event and she told me two things that confirmed some suspicions and made me even more irritated with this situation, main one being that the reason George gave me for not being able to fill the order was false and the second being that she herself had an issue getting paid for her appearance at the event by this guy.  Still, I waited an entire week for my refund to show up in the mail which, again, it never did.  I then sent another e-mail indicating that a complaint to the Rio and legal action were imminent if I didn't receive the refund when I went to the gallery to pick it up in person this past weekend.  That got me a voicemail from George saying he was sorry I had gotten so upset, that he had been hospitalized shortly after our communication the week before and that's the reason he hadn't sent the check yet.  I sent him an e-mail response explaining why it'd gotten to the point of me being so mad and we established that I would come pick up the check in person the next day so this could finally be done with.   After all the excuses, poor communication and having my suspicions confirmed by someone who'd been in a similar situation I did a little looking around before going in.  Wouldn't you know it, during the time George claims he was in the hospital he was leaving posts on his Facebook page sounding completely healthy and at least one of them seeming to indicate that he was AT WORK.  Despite being even angrier about the fact that he continued to lie to me after I threatened legal action, I made it a point to keep my cool when I went in so I could just pick up the check and leave without incident.  George, however, was looking to pick a fight with ME and started giving me a crap as soon as he handed me the check.  One would think, him being in a management position and the whole situation with my order dragging out as long as it did, that he might simply offer me an apology or maybe just keep his mouth shut.  Nope!  He started bringing up the whole hospitalization excuse again in an effort to make me look like a jerk and sarcastically saying ""Nice e-mail"" in response to one or both of the messages I'd previously sent explaining my frustration.  I fired back that I saw his Facebook posts and suspected he was not in the hospital for the period of time he claimed he was and therefore could have mailed the check the previous weekend like he promised.  He then raised his voice at me, in front of other customers, and told me not to come back to the gallery (like I'd even WANT to!!) and saying he was just trying to ""do something nice for me""???  As I was walking out on him he even tried shouting a message that, for some reason, he wanted me to pass on to the alternative model's husband.   I'd been dealing with some other stress outside of this that contributed to me wanting to conclude this failed business transaction ASAP but, unlike George, I didn't feel the need to make this a personal issue.  He was too busy trying to make the whole thing all about HIM and his health issues anyway so I wouldn't have had a chance to explain even if I'd tried.  Anyway, this man is unprofessional, unstable, a liar and should most definitely not be managing a sales job or having any kind of contact with the gallery's customers.  I highly recommend you do NOT trust him with your money!Useful 4FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationSam F.Business Owner1/26/2015I do understand your frustration, however this was not our fault.

If this isn't PRICE GOUGING, I don't know what is.All of their Amy's soups, with the exception of the Minestrone, are $4.49. Even at $4.49 they are NOT a bargain and can be found for less at almost any other store. The Minestrone soup, however, is a WHOPPING $6.49!!!!! Who, in their right mind, would pay $6.49 for a can of soup?????I seriously doubt that anyone at Safeway will read this, let alone respond (they never have in the past), but it is my intention to contact Amy's and make them aware of this situation.For those who are interested, Natural Grocers sells the Amy's line of soups for a more reasonable price. Sprouts has them (or used to have them) for $3.49 and when they are on sale $2.79!! Fry's regular price on these soups is (or used to be) $2.59!!! I haven't checked the Sprouts or Fry's price recently, so it may have changed, but I doubt it is $6.49!!!Shame on you, Safeway.Sign me: Another dissatisfied customerRead more10/14/2020Previous reviewUnless they have moved this product, it appears they have discontinued the Bar Harbor line of stocks and soup.

Took it back and asked them to see what they can do. When I came back to pick it up the second time, I looked it over and before I said anything, Craig said: ""live with it."" ""You just have to learn to live with it"". One heck of a statement to make before I even said anything. But, it still was not straight. I reminded him he said it would look like new and he replied that ""all new seat covers are crooked"". Craig's attitude and demeanor was horrible..

"D D.Las Vegas, NV0142/21/2020Management and maintenance are amazing! From the day I came to inquire about information I had a great feeling about this complex. Felicia, Maddy, and Jessica in the office are wonderful, delightful, and extremely pleasant. They're happy to help with anything you may need, and I can tell they genuinely care about their tenants. Management feels more like friends/family than a landlord. The property is clean, quiet, and very well-maintained. I had a couple issues with the water not being hot enough in my tub/shower, the dining lamp being too low, and some other minor things- maintenance came and fixed things on the same day when I made a request.

"Ashley E.Henderson, NV1303863418/27/2018Lived here for a year now, nothing's but bugs and they don't spray they told me. And maintenance is terrible ever since new management came in. I had to change my own battery for the fire alarm.  I mean 5 mins of their time was too much to ask for asking them to come change it twice. They came 3 days later wanting to change it even though I shouldn't be buying the batteries myself. They was always on top of things too so never had a complaint about them before. Overall nice apartments, quite neighborhood. Neighbors are friendly so is ok, depending on who you talk to. One other problem is, I called in and left an email about how no one picks up after their dogs here. I have stepped in it twice already, no one seems to care. Warning people about that...

"Michelle B.Brandon, FL0275/9/2021We came here to celebrate Mother's Day and we're very underwhelmed. It started off with trying to get into the table we were sat at and couldn't because there was a large box of extra table cloths under the table. We had to wait for our server to lift the table to get it out before we could sit down.  Then immediately after we sat down we were told we were on a time limit to dine because of another large party coming in.Next they were out of the bottle of wine we wanted, we're given dirty plates twice, half of the cheesy garlic bread didn't have cheese on it and the pasta was too al dente.For a big holiday celebration and knowing your number of guests for the day from reservations you would think the restaurant would be better prepared.This used to be one of our favorite Italian restaurants but we won't be back after today's experience.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationConstantina B.Business Customer Service5/10/2021We are sorry for letting you down – especially on such a special day.

"Kayy P.Tallmadge, OH05272/22/20213 photosSecond time at Bucco Di Beppo. My good friend Amanda wanted to take me out for my birthday and she's also pregnant and required Chicken Parm STAT! So I suggested Bucco Di Beppo because that's what I got the first time I went there and I remembered it being amazing. Since it was a special occasion, my friend ordered me not only my favorite glass of wine to go with chicken parm but also a margarita because it's my favorite girly drink. The margarita was very good! I usually get classic margaritas but this fruity one they have was very tasty! The chicken parm, as always, was AMAZING. Not the chicken parm that you have to worry about the breading sliding off or getting soggy. They do not oversauce it and I think that's why it's stays perfect and crispy. Amanda also ordered a small cheese bread and I am not kidding you when I say they came out with a TOWERING plate of delicious cheese bread. It was Huge. Our waitress Emma was phenomenal. She was smiling, she was funny, checked up on us and made the birthday dinner even more enjoyable. Bob, who I am pretty sure is the restaurant manager, also took time to stop by our table and see how everything was. He was super genuine and nice. Even brought me a big ol slice of Tiramisu (which if you didn't know, they make fresh every single day). The whole place just feels like you just stopped over grandmas house.

"Chantel B.Elite '2021Charlotte, NC773046016/27/2020This was my first experience with a walk in chiropractor. I was greeted as soon as I walked in. It had a different setup than what I was expecting but nothing too far fetched. I filled out some paper work and waited for the doctor. The doctor went through the process with me, in detail but fairly quickly, I think it's just the nature of the job, in and out , next patient to patient , so naturally she talks fast. I received some good information about why we should or need to see this type of treatment . I did receive an adjustment and most of it was completely new for me, so naturally it took me a second to get used to the jerks and cracks. They did recommend a treatment plan but I needed to sleep on it. Overall I decided that this type of treatment wasn't for me . I'm kind of scared of it lol If you enjoy this, I would recommend it especially if you're busy and need a convenience of going whenever even later in the evenings . Pricing wasn't bad either .

"K S.Phoenix, AZ02038/14/2015First to ReviewSince I didn't have dental insurance this year, I found a valpak coupon for Best Value Dentistry to get a free exam and xrays. I thought yay I can do this without insurance. My teeth were never that bad anyway. My first appointment I got really great service with Joey (front desk/office manager), the hygienist and Dr Trujillo. They were all very knowledgeable and got dental work done. I didn't make another cleaning appointment because I wasn't sure of my work schedule, which can and does change, but he invited me to call whenever I was ready.Now, despite some minor coloring issues and one problematic tooth, I really never needed extensive dental work--so they're really just good teeth (yay).Well the dental work didn't stay, and so I made another appointment on July 14 with Joey for July 17th, for a cleaning and check out the work. He said to come between 4 and 5. I was surprised and happy that there was an opening this week and thought this has got to be the greatest dental office ever.Got there, no Joey, met Nicole. There were 3 people in the waiting room. Found out that there was no appointment for me. Pretty peeved that I drove in 109 degree heat for a non appointment.She said she could schedule me for Monday, which I did for 7/27, but I asked to have Joey call me to do something about this, like a free cleaning or something, for the hassle of coming down here.Waited the full week of 7/20. No call. My gut feeling figured he wouldn't. He is basically someone who doesn't know how to run a business and hasn't grown up yet. I cancelled 7/27 because of work, and called again this week to schedule with (surprise) Joey for this afternoon. I mentioned to him I didn't get a call about what happened and of course apologized, and that he had many customers and was going to do some sort of audit of the system to find out what happened and call me back in the afternoon. Right. No call, what a surprise. He's not there in the afternoons, except if friends need a cleaning (more on that later). All I needed was a cheap cleaning and maybe some dental work.This morning received a call that the dentist is sick and my appointment will need to be rescheduled. Wow, this is just great, how convenient. I make an appointment and just so happens THIS DAY the dentist is not in. I rescheduled for next week.  I had someone else call and got Joey, who said that they were really busy and couldn't schedule until Monday. Right--they are busy getting a cleaning on the appointment I was supposed to have!So I went there to see how ""busy"" they were and heard a lot of medical equipment going, and oh wow Joey was there. Nobody waiting in the waiting area. He said that there is no dentist today and he is doing cleanings just for friends. How nice. How do I become a friend? I'm only a paying customer. Geez. Then 3 other people walked in toward the dental stations. Of course appointments will need to be rescheduled to accommodate these friends. They're taking my appointment! He apologized of course, then I really gave it to him, saying that even though I don't need $3000 worth  of work I still count as a customer. He apologized again. Would not make up for the lies and the hassle. I was even willing to pay at this appointment before I got here. If he had any business sense, he would have done something to keep me as a customer. But in the end this whole thing was a game, a game to him. Do a free exam to see how bad the teeth are and get $$$ of procedures done. Forget about the others. This ""office"" isn't worth it. Unless you are Joey's friend.Useful 4Funny 2CoolBusiness owner informationDana P.Business Owner10/10/2016Hi- I'm the new owner Dentist at Best Value Dentistry as of September , 2016.

"Mona K.Chandler, AZ3840832/11/2019I called Locksmith Services For All to re-key our new home.  I thought I you'd have to wait a couple of days to have the work redone but they came out the next day. I had all 10 locks done and had two new deadbolts installed.  I also that it was going to take all day to get the work done but I was wrong again. All of this only took about 1-2 hours tops. I was really impressed how quick it was.  Plus the guy (i think it his name was Ben) was really nice and extremely helpful.  I personally would recommend them to my friends here in AZ.Useful 1Funny 1Cool 1Business owner informationBen H.Business Owner3/15/2019Hello Mona.

"Annabel S.Pittsburgh, PA3929/15/2016I found Stephen online when searching up for furniture repair stores online, and was able to book an appointment with him for the following week to help increase the structural integrity of an antique piece of furniture, which had some wood lifting and some gaps in the joints.He was very professional, calling me 30 minutes before our scheduled appointment time, and on time for our appointment. I was actually rather curious about the steps he took, so asked him about them, and he patiently answered my questions, letting me know the rationale behind them. All in all, he was professional, prompt, and easy to work with. He completed the work efficiently, and I am satisfied with the quality of his repairs.

"Tess P.Pittsburgh, PA28251/23/2014First to ReviewStephen Sarocky owner of Eagle Furniture Restoration was contacted by Leader Moving & Storage, the company that moved my husband and I from Ohio last year to come out to look at (and hopefully repair) dozens of items damaged by the Leader's packers and movers.  Finally, he arrived today.  Happy to see him I greeted him at the door with a 'Hey, come on it' and I brought him into the first of our porches (a screened in porch).  I heard my dogs barking and said 'how do you feel about dogs' and pretty quickly he went to 'how do you feel about being sued if one of them bites me?'  Well, that put me on guard instantly.  (He had yet to smile or really acknowledge me at this point).  As I spoke to him about coming into my home with the dogs (clearly he did not want to) I explained they couldn't be put outside (it's 10 degrees today),  he suggested the basement (I explained there's furniture down there to be looked at).  I wanted to let him know we'd had dozens of contractors in the house since purchasing it but he did not want to hear it (I have wonderful dogs by the way).  He said 'can't the dogs be put here?"" meaning the screened in porch....once again, it's 10 degrees out.  Then he said 'how about if I look at them?' and peered at them through a small window.  Seems like he was going to come in but when I gave my Cesar Milan spiel (which works by the way to calm the dogs quickly when meeting strangers) ~ 'no touch, no talk, no eye contact'.  He got really freaked out and said well, I'm not going in there and I tried to explain the reason for my request (every other contractor obliged happily and was impressed at my dogs calm behavior so quickly).  I gave up (still he'd never been friendly to me one time, nor acknowledge me personally being very, very unfriendly during this whole exchange).  I asked him to leave, told him Leader's Moving and Storage has been so difficult to deal with and you are just an extension of them.  I will never, ever let this man near my home again.  He was unfriendly from the moment I smiled and greeted him at the front door and continued that way during our entire meeting.  Bad business!Useful 9Funny 4CoolBusiness owner informationStephen S.Business Owner12/29/2016I'd like to give my side of this story.

"Siddarth S.Pittsburgh, PA016/18/2020I lived at the Brittany apartments for close to 15 months and it was okay for most part until things went haywire because of one person. I stayed at the 8th floor, where there was a fire accident in the month of November 2019. They said it was started by a tenant, but I don't know the details. They wouldn't tell us for some reason. Anyway, here's what happened. We were all evacuated, and the management promised us to reimburse the rent for the time we were displaced for up to 1 month (December 6, to be precise). I kept going back to check on my unit almost once in every 3 days. Fire accidents do happen, and I am completely mindful of that. My apartment had extensive smoke damage and I no longer wished to go back and live there, so I went ahead and broke my lease immediately.After a month, I called the Building Manager to ask about the reimbursement. I was shocked when she said my apartment was ready four days after the fire and so, I will be reimbursed for those 4 days. The apartment was in a horrible condition with strong smoke smells even after a month after the fire, for the record. Also, here's the catch. I received the email about the reimbursement 3 days after the fire (LOL). When I tried to tell her that I received no emails, calls or Voicemails informing me that the apartment was ready, her response was unbelievable. She actually said, ""Oh I think I called you, but you may have missed my call"", which was also a lie. She then went on to use phrases like ""I have no time for this"", ""I am going to end this conversation right here"", ""I have other things to do"" and even went to the extent of throwing insults at me. This pretty much was the case every time I went to her with my concerns about the unit. I am not sure what ""other"" important work she has rather than dealing with the concerns of her tenants in a responsible manner! Isn't that her (ONLY) job? I then decided to draft an email explaining about my situation and sent it to everyone in the upper management of McKinney Properties, and then finally got the money reimbursed (Thankfully, I was able to get their email ids from the corporate website!). To her own supervisor, the Building Manager blatantly lied saying that she couldn't leave a voicemail to me because my voicemail box was full. I have received in total of about 15 voicemails in the last 4 years...not sure how it got full all of a sudden! I could not help but laugh when I heard that. Also, since I ended my lease, I had to pay rent for 90 days. The only way out for me was to find someone else to sign a new lease. I had to contact the Building Manager to help me out with some of the questions that the prospective tenants asked me. The Building Manager constantly ignored my calls for weeks, and during the only time she picked up, she spoke extremely rudely to get back at me for escalating the issue. Thankfully, I didn't lose my composure and did not utter an insult back at her because, by then, I was used to her insolent behavior. I even tried asking her for an alternate contact which she refused to provide. Along this completely arduous process, she consistently said things that contradicted herself, lied time and again with great confidence, and did everything to make my life more miserable, which was already affected by the fire. Oh also, her proud tagline which she often stated was, ""I'm new here. I honestly don't know about this"". For God's sake, she was the only point of contact for the tenants! What were we supposed to do! Whom else were we supposed to go to with concerns about the unit!Overall, it was an utterly painful and a forgettable experience to say the least!Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationProperty M.Business Owner6/24/2020Siddarth, we're sorry for these inconveniences.

"Warren D.Elite '2021Milwaukee, WI1215263612/7/20212 photosThis was a recommendation by the front desk clerk at our hotel and he was spot on! We were able to find parking in their lot without an issue and the tables out front were perfect for al fresco dining.Sarah, our waitress, who reminded me of Harley Quinn just before meeting the Joker, was fantastic. She had great suggestions for food items, and did not steer us wrong. The entrees were amazing, and when it came to dessert, I was pretty well set on the banana pudding, but she strongly recommended I stay away, as it wasn't homemade like the other two desserts (""There's no LOVE in it!,"" she exclaimed. ""It's from a can!""). Having established trust in her previous suggestions, I opted for the peach cobbler and my life really hasn't been the same since. #truestoryAfter dinner, not being from the area, we tried to walk off some of our dinner with a stroll along the walking paths just a block away from the restaurant, along the rail lines. We were impressed with all of the newly-developed buildings and their various architectural details and features.Burnt ends with mac and cheese.

The service was so slow we were ordering drinks before we were even half way done with a round so they'd eventually reach our table. I did love the food options and the extensive beer menu, but I was a bit disappointed by the experience.We had the tabasco fried pickles, which were really good. We also ordered the Combo Platter Whole Lot. I was impressed with the quantity and liked most of the things I tried. However, I would've loved it more if it had been hot when it reached our table. Most of it was lukewarm at best and other parts cold. Truthfully, no one wants to eat cold bbq.I'd definitely give it another shot because the food was promising.

"Kevin Z.Elite '2021Las Vegas, NV3295232214/14/2021Located in the Southend, this spot is everything you could want from a watering hole. Everything is reasonably priced. The vibe is fun. The ambiance is inviting. We started off with the hickory smoked wings. Half in the Western NC BBQ and the other half in the Carolina BBQ. These wings were amazing. They were so good, we ordered them the following day too! For our main entree, we selected the combo platter, Lil Bit (CHOOSE 4: PULLED PORK, PULLED CHICKEN, BEER CAN CHICKEN, ST. LOUIS RIBS, CAROLINA BEEF BRISKET OR TEXAS BEEF SAUSAGE with 2 sides). Ribs, brisket, sausage and the beer can chicken were our choices. With the sides being sweet potato fries and coleslaw. The ribs were the best out of the four selected. The chicken coming in a close second. It says that the Lil Bit combo platter feeds two, but it fed three on this night.  If you're looking for someplace fun without breaking the bank, this is your go to. With an outside patio to enjoy people watching, this place is highly recommended for locals and tourists alike.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationLily A.Business Customer Service4/22/2021Thanks for the great review, Kevin.

"Bre R.Williamsburg, NY012/28/2018I was skeptical going here because it seemed all reviews were either 1 star or 5 stars-- no in-between? I scheduled a regular cleaning that the office reassured me would be covered 100% by my insurance company. Like a lot of the 1 star reviews on here I was told I had multiple cavities (I've never even had 1 before) and was charged $800 for 30 minutes of service and my insurance covered $754. I stilled owed $46, which is only a small portion, but how is a standard cleaning ever $800? Complete and total scam. DO NOT go here under any circumstances.

"Kate H.AZ, AZ65483310/24/2020Wow. This company is doing EVERYTHING right. I recently got a crack in my brand-new car's windshield. My insurance company initially scheduled me with another company and after leaving work and showing up, they were unable to replace it that day due to the safety cameras and recalibration and had very restrictive hours to reschedule.After asking around, I was referred to Best Glass. I called yesterday and Mary answered. I explained the situation and she was so kind and so efficient. She explained, in detail, the process and what to expect with the replacement as well as the required recalibration. She then let me know they would be able to come and install my new glass THAT SAME DAY at the location of my choice. (the last company said I HAD to go to their shop) She said the arrival time would be between 3-5. At about 220, Daniel called and let me know he would be arriving in about 20 minutes. (EARLY!!!) He arrived, let me know the timeline and went to work. When finished, he asked to show me the final product and I was really impressed to see they actually used Hyundai glass, not aftermarket. He was done in less than 40 minutes, no ugly tape put on my car, and it looks amazing. I cannot recommend this company enough. The customer service is stellar from each person I came in contact with and the work is high quality.UsefulFunnyCool 1Business owner informationBob H.Business Owner10/26/2020Thank you for all the kind words Kate.

I've been in a couple of times in the last few months and they have discontinued so many products and what the do carry now seems to be higher priced and geared to the older customer.

She is always careful to thoroughly explain all the fees for cleanings, etc.It occurred to me to write this review after my cleaning visit today. It was my 2-year-old daughter's second cleaning ever and her first at this office. I took her to a pediatric specialist office for her first cleaning, and that did not go well. That office was very busy and loud. She hated it and screamed throughout her cleaning. But worse than that, the visit was about $350!?! Her visit today at Nevada Trails Dental was a dramatically better experience. She did fine throughout her cleaning, due to Ashley the hygienist's patience and fun manner.

"Sherry C.Las Vegas, NV067/8/2020My Mom scheduled an MRI for my Stepdad.  He has a shunt that has to be checked after the MRI and my Mom was told when she made the appointment that they had someone that would be able to do that. She was asked several questions regarding the shunt at the time she scheduled the test that made her feel confident that they knew what needed to be done.  She takes my Stepdad to the appointment.  They get to the point of taking him into the room for the test and the technician tells my Mom that they DO NOT have anyone that can check the shunt after the test.  Why would they bother to ask the qualifying questions about the shunt when she scheduled the appointment if they didn't have anyone qualified to perform the task needed.  Complete waste of time.Useful 1FunnyCool 1Business owner informationStacey W.Business Employee7/10/2020Sherry,  Thank you for this feedback however, we will need more information to investigate your concern.  As we are not allowed to discuss PHI on any social media platform, please email me privately at swebb@sdmi-lv.com with the patient's full name and date of birth.  Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you.Stacey W., CAORead more","Business owner informationStacey W.Business Employee7/10/2020Sherry,  Thank you for this feedback however, we will need more information to investigate your concern.  As we are not allowed to discuss PHI on any social media platform, please email me privately at swebb@sdmi-lv.com with the patient's full name and date of birth.  Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you.Stacey W., CAORead more"
"Aaron S.Henderson, NV029/24/2017NOT SO HONEST OR RELIABLE. We used Carla and her staff to do our 2016 corp taxes at the recommendation of our new bookkeeper and all I can say is that we now regret it dearly. After being told that they would work together and get things sorted out for us asap and agreeing to pay their high prices for what was said to be quality Bookkeeping & CPA work, we waited for months to even hear back from them on the status of our tax filing. This was somewhat expected due to their high volume of returns in tax season but concerned we called Carla's office and were told that an extension was filed weeks back and that everything should be done within a couple months. Sometime later we received our 2016 corp return as promised however it was not aligned accurately with what our 2016 books were reporting as promised. In addition to that, they also decided to tack on a few hundred dollars worth of extra charges to our bill which was not disclosed to us up front and seemed to appear out of thin air. We contacted Carla again to see what was going on with the differences and she informed me that she would look into it and get back to us. We paid her her fees as agreed for the work performed in good faith thinking that she would make things right in the end and guarantee her work, but here it is several months later and just a couple weeks away from the final tax deadline and nothing has been done. Maybe others have had a different experience with Carla and her staff, but based on ours we cannot recommend her services and will definitely not be using her ever again.Useful 1Funny 1CoolBusiness owner informationCarla D.Business Owner9/28/2017Thank you, Aaron, for taking the time to write this lengthy review.  With over 30 years as a CPA it is always been my aim to please our clients and I take their taxes seriously.  Obviously, some misunderstandings have taken place and for that I am truly sorry.  According to my records your 2016 return was filed so if you would please contact my office at your earliest convenience I would like to get this cleared up for you.Read more","Business owner informationCarla D.Business Owner9/28/2017Thank you, Aaron, for taking the time to write this lengthy review.  With over 30 years as a CPA it is always been my aim to please our clients and I take their taxes seriously.  Obviously, some misunderstandings have taken place and for that I am truly sorry.  According to my records your 2016 return was filed so if you would please contact my office at your earliest convenience I would like to get this cleared up for you.Read more"

I was skeptical when the accident occurred as this shop was recommended as my insurance companies preferred shop to take my car. I wanted it to go to the dealerships body shop. I had never heard of Goodfellas. However, I read some reviews here on Yelp before my car was towed from the accident scene, which eased my mind and I had the tow company go ahead bring it to Goodfellas. Glad I made this decision. This shop does GREAT work! The car looks and drives as if nothing was ever wrong with it. I'd definitely recommend this shop and wouldn't hesitate to use them again in the future!

"M J.Mesa, AZ0925/12/2020There are so many disappointing experiences we've had at this location that I will never, in good conscience recommend this vet clinic or bring my pet for treatment here again.  Their scheduling is unreliable and their scheduling staff does not invoke compassion or concern. Our emergency appointment that was booked in the morning for mid afternoon and was rescheduled for the next day despite our pet experiencing internal bleeding.  If we would have known we'd be cancelled, we would have looked elsewhere. After calling back and practically begging to have our pet seen, he was squeezed in an hour before closing.  When we arrived, we spoke with someone else who told us to come in the following day.  We had to insist that we spoke to someone who said we could bring him in. Meds were dispensed and we were advised to return if the symptoms get worse.  At this point we will take our pet elsewhere for any further treatment.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationLisa R.Business Customer Service5/13/2020Hi there, we're so sorry to hear about your frustration with not being able to get seen in a timely manner at our Phoenix hospital.

"Nicole E.Elite '2021Orange County, CA24538522192/3/20218 photosTop golf is located at the far end of Mgm by wet republic. It's a long walk if your walking from inside the hotel so be ready for a trek! Otherwise, ample of parking upfront and free.Reservations required for the most part but if they have open reservations they will accommodate walk ins but I definitely recommend reservations in general. If you arrive early they have an awesome bar with open seating and ample of large screen TVs. Drinks were reasonably priced and had the variety from beer, seltzer's to cocktails. The food menu also looked delicious but ate before so can't comment on the food. The setup is floor levels and can really cater to the masses! This was my first time at any top golf so I wasn't sure what to expect! Once our bay was cleaned we were paged and explained the rules and how everything works. It was greatly appreciated! We were also setup on the score monitor and released. We did an hour ($79 on a Friday) but you can add additional time if available. We also got a cocktail/ food server that kept the drinks coming. Overall, a super fun time even for a first time golfer! I loved that we could just enjoy the lounge area before and after golfing.

"Vanni C.Elite '2021Hayward, CA271964121/18/20211 photoI've been wanting to try top golf for a while now and wasn't sure what to expect .. im happy I finally got to go. It is definitely an ideal group activity or date night.During COVID reservations are required and strongly recommended particularly on weekends. We came on MLK day and called in advance but staff stated that we did not need a reservation because Mondays are slow.. I am guessing they did not anticipate the holiday traffic.. so upon arriving we were advised to make an online reservation right on the spot or else we could not golf .. luckily their were openings within an hour.. One particular staff person was very accommodating and was actually able to get us into a bay within 15 minutes of our arrival despite another staffing insisting  that he could not help us or see the avaliable time slots.. smh refusing to accommodate paying customers is literally the refusal of money for the entire establishment..Anyway staff was kind and helped us get set up..there is a 4 person group limit.We ordered food which was surprisingly good Edamame 5/5- a little salty but good Wings - 4/5 cooked crispy which i liked but they didn't have a lot of sauce/Rub Buffalo chicken dip 5/5Alcoholic drinks (spiked lemonade slushy Kentucky mule pink lemonade) all were really weak and didn't taste like alcohol or give any buzz.. id suggest sticking with the food Price is per hour and based on the level and day of the week. 4th level is more expensive than first etc.A little of everythingUseful 3FunnyCool 1Business owner informationHugh D.Business Customer Service1/19/2021Hi Vanni!

"Desiree H.Elite '2021Monterey Park, CA27017185/31/20211 photoWalked in on a Saturday night without a reservation and got a bay within 35 minutes on the first floor. Higher leveled bays have longer wait times, but since we didn't mind, the first floor was fine for us!Our food and drinks came out very quickly and were delicious! The buffalo chicken dip was probably my favorite dish since it was easy to eat and not too buffalo-y. Both wing flavors were good, but the garlic parmesan ones were a tad on the oilier side in my opinion. Both sides of fries tasted as expected, but were a little bit smaller than expected. All this food, and 2 other pitchers of beer that are not pictured, fed 6 people easily!The golf was super fun and very interactive. They had various games that made hitting the ball more interesting and you could also formulate teams! There a variety of different golf clubs to choose from, so if you're a beginner like me, you can try them all to see which one works best for you!

"Tony H.Elite '2021Chatsworth, CA50747137215/9/20214 photos1 check-inTop golf was an absolute blast, I came here with a group of friends (6 of us total) we had a hub or booth (whatever the area you hit is called) for 2 hours. The balls have some chip inside that detects where they've been hit which keeps score on the little monitor. It's kind of like driving range golf with bowling scores.My buddy reserved our space so I don't really know how all that works, but we got 2 hours to play and had to spend around $300 on food and drinks which was easy enough between 6 of us. The food was really good, the facility itself is pretty amazing. Tons of TVs everywhere to catch sports and ever keep an eye on the score for the game you bet on. The building is pretty much connected to the mgm, they have a tram from the front of the mgm that takes you over (currently cause of the Rona it's not operating) but you can walk all the way through the hotel toward where the pool is to get there or try your luck driving over to their parking lot.Useful 12Funny 5Cool 12Business owner informationHugh D.Business Customer Service5/9/2021Wahoo!

"Wesley W.Elite '2021Monterey Park, CA1297884215/27/20211 check-inIt was just an okay experience.  Waitress seemed a little perturbed and not all that friendly.   As for the game play, the concept is good with multiple games but the programs are glitchy.  We were playing a game hit 3 balls then go to next player and hit their name on the screen.  It looked like the computer switched over but the score registered to the previous player. It wasn't like we were playing fast either.  Other people I've spoken to had similar issues.Also, balls are in bad shape.  I've seen better at range.  But these balls seemed hard and feel dead.  Probably made just for Topgolf to keep balls from going to far.  Clubs were basic.  I don't know if taking your own would make a difference with those crappy balls. As for the food, it was pretty good bar food.  We had some chips and melted cheese thing along boneless wings.  All were pretty good.  Try to get upper deck.  Much cooler view up there.This place would get 4 stars if they would fix their computer glitches.  Games are fun and the drinks good.Useful 1Funny 1Cool 2Business owner informationHugh D.Business Customer Service5/27/2021Hi Wesley.

"Danielle F.Farm Pond, Charlotte, NC0885/8/20195 photosI went there for a balayage- I have dark brown hair !! I wanted to go light brown and ashy. I got a cut as well. I was in the chair for 7 hours - no joke !!!The color I get can be sometimes unpredictable. But the technique was poor. I was charged 148 ... and I hated it. The color and technique did not mesh. it looked as though it was foils that had grown out and not placed evenly to boot. See photos. I had called Shannon the manager and she said since i "" changed my mind "" they would not correct it for free nor did they offer to give a discount  on correction services. The cut also was not layered it was a trim -- there was no cleaning up the layers in order to make a fresh cut.  Therefore not allowing the horrible color to even maybe look good. I was so upset they told me to come in and get a consultation to review it and see what I now wanted. I did not, instead  I went to the Savvy Salon -- and had my world rocked- avoid modern like the plague.Modern - a little advice. If a customer is that unhappy you do everything you can to correct it.

"Daniel F.San Jose, CA141312/29/2015Very happy to be a Volo broadband customer. Just got a fiber install to my apartment when ITV3 refused to provide service due to lack of signups (very silly on ITV3's part, since most students have high turnover for apartments and they have done little to garner student interest). The service is actually a gigabit, you can tell from Speedtest that the speeds are only limited by backbone fiber up to Chicago, etc. The prices are very good for the speed, as compared to local incumbent telco. The install was very quick, professional, and cleanly done. (edit: 5/31/16, ignore this paragraph) On the downsides, you are getting a private IPv4 address with no native IPv6 support, but this is only really a problem if you want to run a server. This is easily alleviated with a VPN, and at gigabit speeds, I really don't mind. The IPv4 exhaustion has been ongoing for years, long before Volo existed, and old telco companies only have the advantage because they have been around longer. If you really need a public IPv4/IPv6 to your residence, you should probably look into business or metro ethernet plans.Nevermind, read the comment by Peter below and the Volo FAQ on their website, x.x.x.254 on your subnet is DMZ'd. You still don't get an IPv6 address, but that's an easier problem to solve compared to no public IPv4.Useful 6Funny 2Cool 3Business owner informationPeter F.Business Owner3/15/2016Thanks for the positive words!  I wanted to mention that even our apartment services are compatible with running your own server.  There is a NAT involved, but you actually have a public static IPV4 address assigned to you.  If you'd like help setting up your equipment to take advantage of it, just give our office a call (best hours for this kind of detailed tech question are 10am-6pm).Read more","Business owner informationPeter F.Business Owner3/15/2016Thanks for the positive words!  I wanted to mention that even our apartment services are compatible with running your own server.  There is a NAT involved, but you actually have a public static IPV4 address assigned to you.  If you'd like help setting up your equipment to take advantage of it, just give our office a call (best hours for this kind of detailed tech question are 10am-6pm).Read more"

"Lance S.Peoria, AZ014/10/2021On 4/3/2021 I went to the Cycle Gear on Reems Rd. to have new tires mounted and balanced. The guys they had doing the mounting and balancing made it obvious they didn't want to do the work. The guy I was first talking to told me he had to get someone else To do it because he was leaving in 30 mins. The next guy got my info and starting looking for the tubes for my tires ( I called ahead to make sure they had them ) He said he was only able to find the front tube and they wouldn't mount my tires until they received the rear tube, so i told him I would go purchase a new rear tube from another place in town and bring it to them. He seemed hesitant but I let him know I needed them done because this is the only time I could do it because I ride the bike to work during the week (went to Ride Now to get the rear tube). By the time I got back they started the front tire. Rear tire was left unattended on showroom floor. Had to find someone in the back to give them the new rear tube. Took them an additional 2 hours to get them done, only to find out they were done incorrectly on my way to work when the front end started to sway on the freeway. Which it has never done before. I called Monday to speak to a manager after work to let him know the situation and that I noticed they had left old weights on one side of the rim. The manager argued that the tires left the ""shop"" perfectly balanced and that it didn't matter that the old weights were still on. And after he told me he has been doing this for a long time and knew what he was talking about I asked him when his balancer was recalibrated. He admitted seemingly proudly that it was around a year to a year and a half that the procedure was done. Which in reality this should be done at the very least twice a month but in reality should be done every morning to ensure safety for anyone who gets their tires balanced (especially for motorcycle tires). After giving him this information he apologized and offered a full refund and a free rebalance. I made him aware that I would prefer to go to a different location due to the Obvious lack of knowledge and ""want to"" at his location. If I was a beginner Rider I could have lost my life due to the lack of attention these people had. Want to keep two wheels down? Don't go to the cycle gear on Reems Road for Mount and balance.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationKiersten T.Business Manager4/12/2021Lance, we are so sorry about your experience - this is not the Cycle Gear difference we pride ourselves on.

He has the most insane knowledge of the human body and how each part is connected. He understands and incorporates eastern and western styles and philosophies to make for a complete healing session.I went to him for a sports massage to dig into my fascia and muscles to help alleviate my chronic neck and back pain from a previous injury and bad posture from working from home on my couch. He really took the time to understand all my issues and didn't stop the session until he felt I would be significantly better. I left the session in complete zen and relaxation for hours. Then, the next day, I was delighted to see my pain had completely gone away.I moved to California shortly after the session. The only issue I have with Scott is he lives in another state.

"Leslie D.Elite '2021Las Vegas, NV84212514994/17/2019MY STORY: I've been working as a nurse for almost 2 years on a critical care floor, and it has severely affected my body the last 3 months. I always come home achy but after my hot shower, stretch, and ice routine I am good. I get a basic massage every few months and I'm satisfied. But man, the last 3 months my neck and lower back has become stiffer, sore, and intolerable. I saw a chiropractor for a month and it was immediately relief, but I'll tense up again after an hour. I thought to myself... I am too young to see a pain specialist (I'm 24F) and I need to get this under control before I cripple myself. My friend recommended me to Scott and now I'm a believer in eastern and western techniques. MY EXPERIENCE: I didn't know what to expect because I kept reading that this wasn't a ""relaxing"" massage but a massage that will fix me. He started off with seeing how strong my upper and lower limbs were, and if one was weaker, he would do these acupuncture techniques and press on certain areas of my body, then repeat the test and surprisingly I did gain strength. It's crazy because when I work out, my trainer would always correct my form because I would favor my right side. I'm writing this review 3 weeks after the massage, and I've noticed a huge difference in my squats in terms of balance and stability. I asked him to focus on my concerned areas (neck, shoulder, and back) and he did an amazing job with loosening the ""knots and tension."" There were some painful moment but I was able to relax and at some point I almost fell asleep. It's difficult to compare his technique to other people because it's that different. It's better than any other deep tissue massage I've received and at the end of the session I felt less restricted and tight. During the next few weeks (with continued stretching too), I felt less muscular pain and weakness. I also felt stronger and more balanced in the gym and at work. OVERALL: He's pricy but definitely worth it. I already booked my next appointment.Useful 8Funny 3Cool 9Business owner informationScott Z.Business Owner9/29/2019Thank you Leslie.

They most likely cut corners and don't actually dry clean your clothes, 3 of my wool clothes were completely damaged as they shrunk more than 4 inches. I basically paid money to them to damage my clothes. Not to mention that it took THREE visits before I reached a resolution. I gave them an opportunity to fix my clothes, which they proved that they were also not capable of. Obviously no dry cleaner wants to refund you money, but it took three whole visits and way too much discussing before they agreed to compensate me.

"Jon W.Las Vegas, NV83343/8/2021Things have changed a lot at Port of Subs since I used to oversee the one on Flamingo and Jones and the one on Highland and W desert inn. They sliced the meat extremely thin, and the cheese was so thin it was almost transparent. I thought they were going to put another layer of chicken but no just one thin layer. I understand they're only supposed to put a certain amount of slices of meat on a sandwich but if it's the butt of the meat and the slices are the size of a piece of salami they should compensate by putting more meat. I don't know if this is their protocol now, or maybe they are trying to save on food cost but I would have liked to have had more meat. Perhaps they should weigh the meat out like they do at restaurants like Arby's so people won't unfair sizes of slices of meat, because if it was a freshly unwrapped piece of chicken the slices would have been a lot bigger. Then before I got rang up I verified that I could get the sandwich for the special advertised on the window which was $15 for a 2-foot sandwich. Then they rang me up at 15.99, I asked them about it before I gave them my card a second time and they said they hadn't applied the discount but would do so, so I assumed they did it and gave them my card but they swiped it without applying the discount, no big deal they gave me $1 in cash back but if I didn't say something a third time I wouldn't have got that dollar. So I would advise if you want the discount you have to make sure two or three times that they have done what they're supposed to do. But the sandwich was good the bread was fresh and the tomatoes looked really nice. I tipped them which I wasn't going to do if they didn't give me the discount, but mainly I was very disappointed in the small amount of meat.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationOlivia Y.Business Customer Service3/9/2021Hello Jon W.!

"Allan K.Las Vegas, NV209239611/19/20181 photoI was looking for a nice way to differentiate my new Tesla Model 3. I didn't really want to spend thousands of dollars a new set of wheels, so I decided on powder coating the factory wheels. They were already fairly sporty, but I just didn't love the original finish.I called Snail on a Tuesday morning about 10am. They said they could turn around a car in a day and a half, so as long as I brought my car in before lunch they'd have it ready for me by the end of the next day. I drove over that morning, dropped my baby off and came back the next afternoon. I called in the morning for an ETA on pickup and was told 4pm. I hopped in a Lyft around 3:45 and sure enough they text me saying they needed more time but unfortunately I was already on my way. I think I drove out of their office around 5:15. That was slightly annoying but I would have sat in traffic had I left later anyway, so not a huge deal. This was a very easy transaction and I'm happy with the results.My car on the left in speedway gray with gloss finish, factory on the right.Useful 4FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationJuan P.Business Owner11/20/2018Hello Allan!

"Amy E.Elite '2021Las Vegas, NV10923620111/18/20171 photoUPDATE2 2: BE CAREFUL OF THEIR VEGAN DONUTS. NABISCO OREOS ARE NOT VEGAN- per the company itself. Oreos are made in a facility that also processes dairy and egg, therefor, there is a risk of cross contamination; hence why they aren't labeled VEGAN on the wrapper. UPDATE: I appreciate the owner commenting, but I have to call out the fact that yes, that is the reputation your donuts have. There are other reviews that have the same issues- donut quality is seriously lacking for the price. Do you even have an ETA on when you'll begin making donuts on site? It's been months since this place has took up residency with zero change.The risk is not worth the reward when there are a small handful of awesome hole in the wall places around Vegas that have been around for years. --------------------JD tried to surprise me the other day because I love donuts and he knows it. It's my favorite go to cheat meal. But this was a huge disappointment. The one donut I got, a regular cronut, was so soggy with oil. It had no crunch to it. The layers were sticking together and there was a fairly large circle of oil that had soaked around the box.JD got 3 more- some fancy, filled donuts. His verdict was that they were overpriced and he'd rather drive the opposite way and tack on an extra 10 minutes while forfeiting the cronies for Ronald's and I'm inclined to agree. He felt so bad that I wasn't able to enjoy, as was I. What a disappointment! I did read on other reviews that their donuts aren't made in location and that freshness was an issue. I can't speak on customer service, as I wasn't the one who went in, but as for the donut itself, one star is fitting as I was totally unable to consume it. Not looking too good... it's like that spot is cursed or something.Useful 5FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationBrett R.Business Owner11/28/2017Hey Amy, thanks so much for your feedback.  I'm sorry to hear that our donuts did not meet your expectations.  That definitely does not sound like the quality donuts we ave known for.  While we do make all of our products fresh from scratch each morning at our Spring Valley location we look forward to begin production on site in the coming weeks.  We absolutely appreciate your business and hope you give us another shot soon to make up for your first visit!Update:  Thanks for the update!  While I do not have an exact date, I believe we will begin production on site this week or next.  We appreciate your patience as we wrap up some necessary details.  Also, while Oreos are inherently Vegan, per their ingredients, there is always a risk of cross contamination in any facility that uses dairy which is why we identify all of our Vegan products as ""Vegan Friendly"".Since our inception in 2015 we have actually maintained a solid 4.5 stars.  We realize there will always be hurdles to overcome as with any new store and we intend to dominate each and every one as we have in the past.  While the reviews you reference represent a significant minority we do read and respond to every single one and take in to consideration everyone's feedback in order to improve our products and service.  Also, after careful market analysis we've found that the price of our donuts fall right in line with our competitors.  Where else can you get a fresh hot Donut Ice Cream Sandwich in town?We definitely would love to see you again soon and appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us!Read more","Business owner informationBrett R.Business Owner11/28/2017Hey Amy, thanks so much for your feedback.  I'm sorry to hear that our donuts did not meet your expectations.  That definitely does not sound like the quality donuts we ave known for.  While we do make all of our products fresh from scratch each morning at our Spring Valley location we look forward to begin production on site in the coming weeks.  We absolutely appreciate your business and hope you give us another shot soon to make up for your first visit!Update:  Thanks for the update!  While I do not have an exact date, I believe we will begin production on site this week or next.  We appreciate your patience as we wrap up some necessary details.  Also, while Oreos are inherently Vegan, per their ingredients, there is always a risk of cross contamination in any facility that uses dairy which is why we identify all of our Vegan products as ""Vegan Friendly"".Since our inception in 2015 we have actually maintained a solid 4.5 stars.  We realize there will always be hurdles to overcome as with any new store and we intend to dominate each and every one as we have in the past.  While the reviews you reference represent a significant minority we do read and respond to every single one and take in to consideration everyone's feedback in order to improve our products and service.  Also, after careful market analysis we've found that the price of our donuts fall right in line with our competitors.  Where else can you get a fresh hot Donut Ice Cream Sandwich in town?We definitely would love to see you again soon and appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us!Read more"
"Chris V.Elite '2021Henderson, NV9401268956810/25/20177 photosMerriam-Webster defines ""mania"" as ""excessive or unreasonable enthusiasm."" From my experience, it's unreasonable to get enthused about this place.I've actually not taken the opportunity to try Donut Mania until a Yelp friend organized a get-together with other Yelpers at the newest store of this burgeoning chain all the way in North Las Vegas. This location was still in a soft opening phase, with ice cream unavailable and donuts currently not baked here but at one of their other shops, but still freshly made every morning.We had an evening date, so presumably the freshness wasn't optimal, but I had some great bites anyway. Few items were especially memorable flavor-wise, but they have a huge variety of consistently soft and chewy raised donuts that pay homage to a wide variety of dessert concepts.Reese's Pieces? Samoa cookies? Yep, they've got creations that honor both.Maple bacon bars? Oh yes, please. Their contrast of the savory, smoky flavors of bacon with the sweetness of maple is as good as any rendition.Apple fritters? With a great glaze (perhaps brown sugar) and an unusually light, almost airy interior, these monster-sized treats will make any fans of that dessert happy.Cronuts? Nope, for trademark reasons, but they have ""crodoughs"" that are surprisingly satisfying, despite the interior appearing more like a visual homage to a croissant rather than a true replication of the typically chewy dough with discernable layers. This version is soft like a donut, which makes it less special in my book.Cake donuts? They don't have that many of those, but we tried the vegan cake. It was oddly satisfying, although it has a different mouthfeel than traditional cake donuts, which was somewhat changing in texture.I could go on and on about the multitude of other raised donuts, including a delicious raspberry jelly-filled, but they're all fairly run-of-the-mill flavors on the same donuts - well, except one that I assume is seasonal, a pumpkin chiffon. Definitely get one if you enjoy the autumnal pumpkin pie flavor in a creamy texture.(None of my usual notes on pricing because signage wasn't up and we just pooled cash to Christie L. anyway, but that aspect is subjective. Oh, and I will add that I was not witness to other possible transgressions of their employees on other occasions, but do respect my Yelp friends' thoughts and ask that you read their reviews and take heed.)Overall, nothing is absolutely stunning flavor-wise, and some traditional donuts are underrepresented or entirely omitted from the menu in favor of a variety of delicious raised donuts, but they have a very satisfying and consistently delicious selection of those. My next craving might just land me at a Donut Mania (albeit the Henderson location, which is much closer to me).See all photos from Chris V. for Donut ManiaUseful 11Funny 7Cool 8Business owner informationBrett R.Business Owner10/30/2017Hey Chris, thanks so much for coming out to our newest location and providing us your feedback!  We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your donuts and look forward to seeing you again soon at our Henderson location!Read more","Business owner informationBrett R.Business Owner10/30/2017Hey Chris, thanks so much for coming out to our newest location and providing us your feedback!  We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your donuts and look forward to seeing you again soon at our Henderson location!Read more"
"Michael U.Las Vegas, NV3387491312706311/21/201756 photosAlways the bridesmaid when discussing Sin City's best Donut shops, the classics not on par with Friendly or Ace while innovative options lag behind Pink Box despite ownership's claim to have created the recipe for both they and Glazier's, it was largely out of curiosity about recent promotions featuring the cast of Tanked that the decision was made to attend Donut Mania's North Las Vegas *Grand Opening*on Saturday, their acquisition of rapidly shuttered Crunch Donuts a questionable financial decision considering the location almost thirty minutes by car from the Strip.Having wanted to like Donut Mania from the very beginnning, an inauspicious first visit to the Durango flagship well documented but seemingly improved upon during a visit to the Henderson location, it was expectedly to a full parking lot that the car was navigated just twenty minutes after the event's official 11:00am start time, one reality-TV star stationed at the door and the other located inside taking pictures with fans while additionally obstructing the flow of traffic.Narrow and barely an ADA-compliant space, this fact not stopping one family from completely filling the shop while spending nearly ten minutes trying to assemble a dozen, it was while talking with Brett Raymer who revealed himself as ""the money and marketing"" that guests waited (im)patiently, the single cashier and two girls collecting fried Dough from the case additionally slowed down when asked to make Donut Mania's recently launched Ice Cream Sandwich.Pretty up-front about my affinity for Donuts, and perhaps less obviously a former aquarium enthusiast, it was finally upon reaching the front of the line that options were properly able to be perused, the decision to order a half-dozen added upon by one of Donut Mania's $3 ""World Famous Fritters"" and the aforementioned plain Donut loaded with Chocolate Ice Cream and placed in a heated press, a good idea completely botched by using poorly frozen product from Thrifty and an unlined wrapper which saw glaze stuck to it, melted Ice Cream quickly dripping through and more than a quarter of the $5 item left on the ground outside.Thankfully carrying extra napkins, hands now sticky and the throng making a restroom trip to wash them a hassle, it was with additional parts of the $20.39 order taken elsewhere that the Fritter was next tasted, the ""World Famous"" claim up for debate but nice and crisp with plenty of Fruit while the Italian Rum topped with stiff Cream and a Maraschino Cherry was also quite pleasant, similar to when it was originally tasted on Green Valley Parkway several months back.Predictably suffering once again from either the temperature of the oil or too much gluten in the batter, both ""Donutella"" and Rocky Road slightly crispy on the surface with a dry crumb that fortunately benefitted in the latter's ample pocket of Chocolate Cream, it took only one bite of the Buttermilk Bar to confirm that nothing has improved since February 2015 in terms of the grainy texture, the Oreo Cheesecake not so different from the Cheesecake options at Pink Box, perhaps because of the thicker consistency of the Cream Cheese and ground up Cookie filling.Rounding out the morning with a stuffed Donut titled ""Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough,"" the same stiff Cream from Italian Rum and Chocolate filling from Rocky Road found beneath an upright-standing half-Cookie, there was absolutely nothing about this Donut that suggested Cookie Dough save for the Cookie itself, the owner's son Steven reaching out on Social Media less than 6-hours later to state ""We are actually in the midst of developing an improved cookie dough filling that is shelf stable and will really give it the flavor deserving of its name.""TWO STARS:  I think it is fairly obvious that I like Donuts and I'm also pretty fond of Aquariums, so although I'm not really sure what Tanked has to do with DONUT MANIA aside from one of the Stars saying he was ""the money and marketing"" at the Grand Opening in North Las Vegas yesterday morning I do know that the event and product was a mess, the stars of the show placing themselves inside already limited confines and thus constraining traffic while the product was rarely worth the price.See all photos from Michael U. for Donut ManiaUseful 12Funny 7Cool 8Business owner informationBrett R.Business Owner11/21/2017Hey Michael, as always thank you so much for your feedback!

"Alexandra M.Chandler, AZ25417144/20/20194 photosUpdate from last comment from salon: I find it funny how you decide to mix up the whole story First of, lets be honest - you do NOT have 700 nail  colors available- at all LOL! Secondly , You can clearly tell the nail you fixed was messed up and super uneven ... and to add something else - I went to my normal spot - and before I even told them what happened,  they seen your work and said ""that needs to be fixed or taken of"" , when my nail tech began filing the nail.. the nail stared to lift from the side .. you thought it would be a good idea to.put a nail tip on my ring finger especially seeing how it was , but yet Im in the wrong haha Lastly,  lets recap to what happened.. you had me waiting 25 minutes,  left with no explanation.  I had to go ask someone for help because your communicated soo poorly .  And as a sidenote,  I do not care about what your other ""customers "" wanted to do and or say . They obviously didnt say a single word while I was there, plus I like my work done with quality and  done professionally.  This is why you have all these poor reviews, haha - please do not waste your time nor my time shall we ? BEWARE IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO GET YOUR NAILS DONE,  PLEASE - RETHINK YOUR DECISION If you want uneven , unshaped , unsanitary service and poor customer service then come here ! LOL I have been doing my nails for years now, and I've never had such a bad experience like I did here My usual nail salon ""Glitter Nail Bar"" which is down the street was busy .. and me being on a time schedule due to an event , i decided to come here They have such a limited color variety here - The shaping to my nail that i requested pointy was horrible ( see pictures as proof) The nail popped off on top of that once I went to my other salon for them to fix this mess they caused here at Pink Lotus I waited 25 minutes for a question to get answered,  I had to get up and see what was going on . And they tell me they cant match the color . Okay , i understand that - asked how much for a nail polish change . Never got a response. I tell the lady to just cash me out for the 2 broken nails I needed fixed And these fools want to charge me $15 ( see pictures, this is not $15 nor ""PROFESSIONAL"" WORK The lady tells me to speak with owner ( which he did my nails) He proceeds to tell me he didnt cut the tips and it was my fault for moving around so long .. mind you my nails are all bruised and blending at this point I show the 2 other customers sitting there the comparision in nails ... they agreed as well . Owner tells me Im wasting his time - no sir you are wasting MY time .  Shame on you! I should've checked the reviews before i arrived to this hell hole .Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationMinh H.Business Owner4/21/2019Good morning Alexandra M. I told you right from the beginning you should check out our color selection if it match your color and you were on the phone the whole time. You walked in the nails salon to fix two nails and were told about 30 min wait and you are ok with that. Everyone here had a appointments ahead of time. You should know my salon is full of customers and i still try to help you within 10 min not 30 min as i said. Your fingers got cuts, bruised, damaged everywhere after the trip from Rocky point. I tried to fix and glued the rest of the nails and even gave the band aids wishing it heals first before i can do anything. I fixed only two full lenght tips without .cutting them and ask you nicely is it ok because it is still shorter than your nails and you said it is ok since it is long already so it won't make any different. During the whole process of fixing nails you kept pulling the finger and move around while still talking on the phone which slowed down the process and impossible for me the perform the nails art. On one damaged nails i said i let it heal first because it will be infected if i put the nail on . Since you can't find the color match from our over 700 gel color selections, i have to let you sit there to pick out your color you wanted and move on to my appointmented customers. At the end, when you said you only paid for one nail fix, two waiting customers almost got out of the chairs to fight with you because they saw the whole things.i don't want things happen likes that so i only charge you $7 for my 30 min of works , all my clients told me you should charged her the whole things not $7 dollars. I have to let you go so my clients will continuing to have a wonderful time here. I am sorry the inconvenient which may have caused you.

I called ahead but they said we did not need a reservation for 2 people.Upon arrival we were seated right away and given water................then they forgot about usWe finally flagged down another server (as we could not see ours anywhere) and she took our order.Hubby had the beef vindaloo which he said was tasty, spicy, but lacking in beef.There was not much that was vegetarian, gluten free and dairy free. I opted for the lettuce wraps but I'm not sure if the noodles on top were gluten free. At that time I just wanted to eat  something and go home so I ate it (thank goodness I don't have celiac).

"Nicole G.South Forest Park, Everett, WA34722422/6/20192 photosJust want to start off by saying in short- you will not regret your experience here!!!My boyfriend took me to this place as a Christmas gift, and we went this past Saturday. Online it had told us that we needed to email to reserve a time and activity, so make sure you do that beforehand. We got there with the confirmation email, but my boyfriend had accidentally reserved the time for Sunday instead, but they were so kind & had said it was okay for us to do it right then.We opted for the Paint and Sip, which I had no idea how it worked but we were excited. Walking in, the place was so cutely decorated on the inside & was visually pleasing. We were greeted by two of the workers who were so lovely! They were very accommodating & seemed genuine in making sure we felt comfortable there. They set us up with stencils & instructions for the templates we chose, but told us we obviously didn't need to necessarily follow it. She set us up in the corner of the room while we ordered some drinks. I had the $14 bottomless mimosas (such a great deal!!!) and my boyfriend chose a beer. The instructions said mine would take 1.5 hours approximately, and his called for 2 hours so it was a challenge to see how long it took. Our 16x20 canvasses had the stencils on top, so we traced out our pictures. Mine was initially showing the silhouette of a father and a child, but I changed it up to kind of reflect me and my boyfriend's. It was kinda cool how we did have a template but we were free to do whatever we wanted essentially. The paints were available on a nearby cart, with mixing cups and paintbrushes for us to grab whenever we needed it. Very accessible and whenever we had questions we didn't feel any hesitation to do so. Painting wasn't our strong suite so it was awesome to have assistance when needed but they also let us do our thing for most of the time!We got there at 1pm, and we didn't finish until 4:30! We did take our time though and it was so much fun, we had no pressure from the workers either to leave or anything like that. In fact they would constantly check up on us, give us advice when we asked, and kept my bottomless mimosa always full ;) when we had walked in there were probably one other party there, but by the time we had left it was full of children and parents who were also having a lot of fun making crafts. Great environment!It was a Christmas gift but we used it during our 2 year anniversary weekend so the experience my boyfriend & I had was so so fun, the workers would make sure we were having a blast! Will definitely come back maybe to do another painting or experience a different activity soon!!!Mine somehow took a shorter amount of time so I'm just waiting for my boyfriend to be done hahaThe finished products!Useful 1FunnyCool 1Business owner informationBrooke R.Business Owner2/6/2019Thank you so much for taking the time to write about your experience.

I ordered the House Boil. All of the shrimp, mussels, and clams were steamed perfectly. Not rubbery or too chewy. The sauce was good, a little salty, and would have been perfect with some rice!I ended up dipping some of the  complimentary rolls in the sauce and wowza! My dad ordered clam chowder and seemed to enjoy. My brother ordered jambalaya (he mentioned that they don't mess around with the spice levels. Last time he ordered a 7 and it was too hot.

"Dana J.Elite '2021Las Vegas, NV311334410/11/20203 photosI'm so glad this Oyster Bar is still able to operate during Covid. This place is a hidden gem located inside Sunset Casino in Henderson. Located right across the street from the Galleria Mall. You can park at the bowling alley entrance and it's a short walk to the Oyster bar. They have plenty of seating around the bar and your still able to social distance. There are also table set up around the bar for larger parties (4-5 people) if you don't want to sit at the bars The seafood is delicious. We order the charbroiled oysters, shrimp cocktail, king crab legs and drinks.  The bill was $191 but mostly because we had two orders of crab legs. A couple can eat for much less because most of the entrees are between $20-30. The crab legs were the best you didn't have to crack any shells the crab legs were given to you with only half the shell a so it makes it very easy to eat. The food I give 5 yelp stars everything was delicious and I can't wait to go back. All the staff was friendly and the prices are reasonable. Definitely one of my new favorite seafood places in Henderson for a date night.Useful 4Funny 2Cool 3Business owner informationMikhail H.Business Owner10/13/2020Well thank you for that great review Dana!  Sunset Station loves when great guests like you have a great time with us!Read more",Business owner informationMikhail H.Business Owner10/13/2020Well thank you for that great review Dana!  Sunset Station loves when great guests like you have a great time with us!Read more

Wow, nasty response from owner. Leslie, I stated I drove 45 miles so clearly I'm not going to see some piece of paper on the door until I get there. Just close the doors.

"James O.Phoenix, AZ01333/14/2020Not a fan of this place! Took my truck in awhile ago for an oil change and tire rotation. When I left i was told there was a lug nut missing. Odd, I thought but okay. I left, bought another one and replaced it and in doing so, i noticed my tires and it looked like they weren't moved. I went back 4 months later for the same thing, but this time I marked one of my tires. When I left i looked at the tires and went back into the office because it confirmed my suspension, they didn't do a tire rotation but led me to believe it had been done. They gave me some story ""you don't really need to rotate often (or some crap). So when my truck needed the next oil change I decided to do it myself. Low and behold, I found that they didn't put the recommended oil filter size on my truck last time. I probably wouldn't be an EX customer if they were transparent, but the sneaky deception is not right in my mind.Thank you for your replay, condescending as it may be. If you would have read my entire post, you would have learned that my issue had nothing to do with the lug nut; it was merely a explanation to my experience. The real take home, had to do with the inability to be honest and treat customers with dignity and respect; as you showcased in you reply. Also, please keep your ""4 important remarks"", because as a truck driver, I am completely aware of what a tire rotation is and the fact the primary weight of most vehicles are supported by the front two tires. But what I would suggest you do in the future, is not talk down or around your customers when you feel a service they request is unnecessary, and actually take them out and show them what you mean, as to minimize confusion. Because if you HAD done this, I would have pointed out that the inside of the two front tires were extremely low thread, and the back ones were't, which is why I recently had them replaced. As for the oil filter, yes I am aware that the threads are not interchangeable. However, I purchased the same brand put on at your place, but the size that was recommended for my vehicle and it was longer, almost 25% longer. So NO, I will not come by for ""you to buy me a 2 dollar lug nut"" (but you charge $9.50 for) because I have found someone that can do the things I either can't or, more realistically don't want to do on my vehicle. Someone that exceeds you in professionalism and customer service, as this person has honesty and integrity. I will also mention that since we share the same neighborhood, I have not been shy about sharing my experience and opinions about your business practices to our neighbors, so I am glad you were able to reply, so others can clearly see how you speak to your customers. Furthermore, I find it disturbing that you were able to access your ""notes"" on my vehicle from almost 2 years ago at 6pm, when your office closes at 4pm. So if you can please remove my information from your database, because I will NEVER return. And I suggest readers of this post seek alternate car service as well.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationHamza S.Business Owner3/14/2020Thank you for reaching out, I’d like to make 4 important remarks to you: 1- we have no interest in losing a customer over a 2 dollar lugnut, if we said you’re missing one, then you were missing one. If you have doubts, simply ask us to review the 16 cameras we have installed in the shop2-Tire rotation is the practice of moving the wheels and tires of an automobile from one position to another, to ensure even tire wear. Even tire wear is desirable to extend the useful life of a set of tires.The weight on the front and rear axles differs which causes uneven wear. With the majority of cars having the engine in front, the front tires typically bear more weight than the rear tires which wears the front tires quicker. At the time of your visit, my notes show your front tires had higher tread, which means a tire rotation was not needed. Which is also why you were never charged for a tire rotation3-You cannot install a wrong spin-on oil filter, if it’s the wrong oil filter, it will not fit and leak all the oil before it even leaves the shop causing engine failure. Maybe you mean the height of the oil filter?! Which depends on the brand name you use. For example: filters for the same car made by Valvoline and mobile 1 have different heights. 4-when in doubt, always ask for camera footage. Come by any day and we’ll buy you a lugnut, no need to stress out over 2 dollars and a tire rotation when you can simply ask for it. Don’t let our professional advice get in the way of what you want. Thank you for sharing your feelings, Don’t be shy next time, simply ask. Have a good day.Read more","Business owner informationHamza S.Business Owner3/14/2020Thank you for reaching out, I’d like to make 4 important remarks to you: 1- we have no interest in losing a customer over a 2 dollar lugnut, if we said you’re missing one, then you were missing one.

"Rachel M.Phoenix, AZ522/10/2019I took my truck in to replace a timing belt and water pump which is recommended every 60,000 miles. 16 months and 12,000 miles later I was out of town when my water pump gave out which cause my timing belt to move and my engine to cease working.I immediately called shop and they said I could bring truck in and they would look at it My problem was I was 200 miles away and I already knew what the issue was since I had two shop where I broke down look at it. I wanted to know if they would stand by the work they had done and fix my engine Their answer was no because two months after work was done, shop was sold to new owner He would NOT take any liability for work done by previous owner . I'm sorry, what?  Buyer beware just because same sign was there doesn't mean warranty gets transferred. These people are wolves in sheeps clothing. It ended costing over $6,000 to get engine rebuilt with towing 200 miles, car rental for 3 weeks and other expenses. I don't know it they are using after market parts, all I know is that I would never use this shop againUseful 2FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationHamza S.Business Owner2/20/2019Thank you for sharing your feedback Madam, but as I discussed with you on the phone previously, I simply cannot cover a warranty on a job that we did not perform.

I have no way to confirm what was done on your vehicle, who worked on it, whether they used after market parts or whether they were even qualified to perform the job. I understand your frustration that your water pump failed even though you had the previous company replace it, however would you be frustrated with me if i had opened a flower shop or gas station here. Whats right is right, i suggest your frustration be directed on either the manufacturer of the water pump or the previous company, please re-consider who you are holding responsible here, we simply bought the shop (with the property) and just want to make an honest living. We stand by all the work we do. Your consideration is highly appreciated, please let us know how we can help in any way.

"Julie D.Dunellen, NJ661216/12/20201 photoDawn provided me with a reading that gave me a lot of peace and comfort at a time when I was grieving and questioning everything that I did. My mother contracted covid in a nursing home in New Jersey and she passed away. I was devastated. Dawn absolutely contacted her and my father came through as well. I knew it was them because they both described themselves with many details ... my father showed her the crossword puzzles he did and the lighter he used to flip and how he smoked so much and how he was from the Midwest. And my mother told her what her hair looked like and how her left arm was injured and that was absolutely true she had broken her upper arm. There were many more details.  I was really amazed.

I spent the next few days after our meeting processing everything that was said and taking Dawn's recommendations to heart. I had no idea what to expect going in to it and I assumed it would be very emotional for me. But Dawn made me feel comfortable and at ease and explained everything at the start of our session which made feel like I was in the right place. I have many loved ones that have passed that I had questions for and I went to Dawn to see if she could help provide the clarity I needed. Dawn's ability to connect with my loved ones and then being able to sense each of their personalities come through made my heart feel so amazing. Dawn gave me the reassurance I needed to know that our loved ones are always with us.

"Mrs. R.Charlotte, NC440210/2/2020I brought my family here late last night because we were looking for decent outdoor seating. I can't comment on the cleanliness of the place, because we didn't go inside. The food did take a while to come out, and our drinks did sit empty for a while mid-meal, even though they weren't all that busy, but the food was good. The one-star rating is based upon our experience with the waitress, Alexa. I said to the waitress that I could either get a chicken nugget kids' meal for my poodle for around $7, or add bacon Mac and cheese on to my meal and two sides I had already chosen for $4, and she said yes. When the bill came, we were charged $7 for the Mac n cheese. I told her it was supposed to be $4, and she argued that it was $7, even though she and I had the little conversation about how the Mac 'n cheese was a better deal than the chicken nugget kids' meal. On a $130 meal, she was willing to squabble over a $3 difference. She didn't offer to get the manager or change the charge, even though she and I had spoken about it while I was ordering. I didn't press the issue, because most places wouldn't have even had a back-and-forth over it. I had $60 cash left over from my spending of the day, which I was expecting to leave on the table as a tip so it would be tax-free, but left $26 on my credit card instead.

I just left this Bonefish (where I have eaten many times over the past years). 15 minutes spent with not even so much as a glass of water and some flatware. A hostess who moseyed up to the stand so nonchalant that I wasn't even sure she worked there and then a waiter who did things like run and get extra oil for the table beside me without even so much as a greeting. If you have limited staff during off hours then it should be the job of ALL the working staff to service the guests. There was no reason for me to sit that long (on my limited lunch break) without a drink or placing my order as your hostess slumped at the stand. I walked over to Eez Fusion-promptly greeted, sat, drink delivered, and food order in within 10 minutes. So just so you know there are other restaurants doing this COVID service much better than you.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationBonefish C.Business Customer Service11/18/2020Hello Kristin,We don’t like the sound of this.

"Bre M.Gilbert, AZ028/13/2020My husband was one of the first residents of Camden Tempe and we continued to live there until August 2020. We lived in the B4 floor plan and never felt so comfortable. The apartment was absolutely gorgeous, so well made and intentionally designed. We truly felt like Camden Tempe was our home. We went through many managers of the property but the managers right now, Lisa and Lonnie exceeded expectations. They were incredibly kind, helpful and assertive. Camden Tempe never felt better!! They both are open for conversation and take care of residents needs as fast as they possibly can. We will forever miss having apartment managers like them. Although the area of North Tempe/south scottsdale has struggled with more transient people recently, we really feel like management is doing everything they can to help this issue, and we never once had an actual issue with this problem. Camden's location is so central and extremely accessible. We were able to enjoy Tempe, Scottsdale and Phoenix while being able to drive down to the east valley as well very easily. The amenities are great, and we especially loved the pool. Maintenance was friendly and hard working as well. We will forever miss Camden and will always have fond memories there. If you are looking for a place to live, we highly recommend Camden Tempe!UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationCamden ManagerBusiness Manager8/13/2020Hello Bre,Thank you so much for taking the time to share your kind words about our community.

"John H.Tustin, CA11153/3/2021Camden's design of living quarters is commendable and they are nicely functional.  Where they fail and I mean fail miserably is garage parking and visitor parking.  For the hundreds of residents they have 15 visitor spaces and no means of accommodating friends or family or visitors. No thought. No consideration.  Simply put.  If you have friends or family don't live there.  In fact they go a step farther and hire a towing company to remove those outsiders quickly and very costly to those towed.  Its a sure bet they get a kickback. The garage, that you pay dearly for, only works if you are in your 30's or younger and super skinny.  Literally, I measured it.  My small SUV fits with two inches on each side of the door way.  Are you out of your mind?!?!?!The designers should be forced to use what they built; they would suffer!They are building more?!?!?!?  Hopefully, more thought was done in the design but I doubt it.   Shame on the cities that approve this scam and shame on Camden; thoughtless, selfish, inconsiderate, hateful, sickening.  There are not enough adjectives to describe the unprofessionalism involved and this is all the way up through the corporate level.  Yes, I contacted management and to get a space for one day you have to pay a month but only if there is one available.  I called corporate and after putting me on endless hold twice I got a person who said to find a street over a quarter of a mile away and to walk.  Hello, no side walks in that direction.  Again, they don't care.If you got family or friends... go somewhere else!UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationCamden ManagerBusiness Manager4/8/2021Hi There, I'm so happy to hear that you are enjoying the living space of your apartment home, but we have a ways to go with ensuring that you aren't having frustrations around parking. I'm sorry that you are disappointed with that aspect of your living experience here. Because we don't have the space, we reserve the parking inside of the gates for residents only. I definitely acknowledge that visitor parking can get taken quickly in the 15 marked visitor spaces in front of the Leasing Office. We currently have a total of 51 visitor spaces which includes the overflow parking on the West and North sides of the community outside of the gates. If you would like for me to show you those areas, please let me know and I will be happy to help. The only places that visitors can't park without the risk of being towed is the permit spaces (for residents only), the reserved covered parking spaces, or the commercial parking lot North of the overflow parking. We regularly remind residents that doing so can result in getting their vehicle towed. Camden Tempe receives no money from the towing company for monitoring and towing from our parking lots. The good news is that with our Phase 2 we will be adding somewhere around 40 extra visitor spaces between our Phase I and Phase II. Those should be available for use sometime this summer. In addition, we will be installing a pedestrian gate on the West side of the community so that guests can easily get from overflow into the community when the resident gives them access through the Chirp app. Phase 2 will only have assigned covered parking spaces for residents and no garages. I'd love an opportunity to chat with you and see if we may have the ability to switch your garage for a carport instead. We don't have a lot that are available, but depending on the size of your apartment home and your location in the community we do have a couple of possible options. If that interests you at all, please contact me directly and I would be happy to help. Also, if you are ever experiencing any future frustrations please feel free to call or email me. I'm always available to talk through these concerns with residents. Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback.

"Jay H.Peoria, AZ184410/12/20204 photosIf you're going to spend $1,650/mo for a one bedroom then rent somewhere else and get your money's worth. There is trash piled up by the dumpsters all of the time and litter on the ground. The pics are just the walk from my unit to my vehicle. The office staff ignored my request by not following up. The grounds stink like dog piss and the neighbors are loud and inconsiderate. When we first moved in I approached the maintenance supervisor about an issue and he accused me of being drunk.

"Tedd S.Las Vegas, NV256214/18/2019Having lived at Camden Hayden since it was opened I've experienced my fare share of management changes and community changes. Originally the property was immaculate, with adequate and attentive staffing that held numerous community events and fostered a quality apartment complex. Unfortunately this property is not the same as it once was.Rampant theft occurs in vehicles parked in their own garages. Homeless men washing themselves in the hot tub in the early mornings. The once towel service at the pool is no longer available. The noise complaint process is broken. Landscaping occurs weekend mornings, which result in people being woken up at 7am on a Sunday. Parking is a joke. Valet Trash isn't necessary, yet they charge every tenant for it, because Camden makes a profit from the service. Lastly, my family members are forced to park outside the gate because I live in a single bedroom and am only allowed my one space.. which I pay for. Overall, the leasing office and Camden Hayden team show little regard to hiring adequate security or staff for the property to make the community feel safe in their own apartments. The once great community no longer exists.If you are looking for an apartment complex. This isn't the one.Useful 4FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationCamden ManagerBusiness Manager4/22/2019Hi Tedd, We are disappointed to hear your experience with us has not been great.

"Harold G.Phoenix, AZ1291069/8/2019Updated reviewPlease note everything I said before was true but as soon as the management changed up the apartments went to shit! Cars were broken into, my roommates truck tail gate was stolen & the property had nothing to say about it. Whatever you do when leasing an apartment from them, do not get an apartment in the back. Watch out for your packages getting stolen & beware of never having a place to park! Lastly really make sure you make what is wrong during your move in or you'll be charged. I was charged for a stove topthat was already scratch when I moved in. So I had to go in & speak with Cody on getting those charges taken off.

I really don't like leaving negative reviews, but this has been an ongoing problem for many years, and frankly is becoming such a turn-off, that I am hesitant to keep shopping their stores. It's sad too, because MSA and MSC have been my go-to's since the mid 90's for great brands at good prices. I am a 20+ year consigner with these stores and usually don't even get a ""hello"", let alone a smile. It's a completely negative, unfriendly, unhelpful vibe.

Thanks again, HHRead more10/16/2015Previous reviewHungry Howie loves carbs.  I ordered something, it is like a calzone but has almost no filling.  Didn't buy dipping sauce?  Inedible.  I opened a jar of pasta sauce to compensate.  I had the little to no flavor beef with flavorless cheese product.  The quality of the filling is irrelevant because the quantity is overbearing with its absence.I ate here to keep my southwest miles from expiring.  I essentially threw away of $5.  I should have spent .50 on a dipping sauce and nothing else since even .01 will keep my miles current.They are moving the location because it is hard to find and annoying to get to.I really wanted to like this place but it is half as good as Domino's and I will let you take that however you want.  Is it worse than Pizza Hut?  Depends, I hate the hut so it may be close.Read more","Business owner informationHowies R.Business Customer Service11/2/2015Dave,Thanks for giving us a second chance.

"Jake F.New York, NY0137/1/2016The reason it's called Hungry Howies is because they don't deliver.... DO NOT ORDER HERE!!! Subpar poor quality product and the WORST customer service ever. The girl who answered was so out of it that it took ten minutes to order a small cheese pizza and wings. Learn your menu darling. I'm using exact terms from the menu to order and she was confused what a ""build your own"" small cheese pizza was. After dealing with the barely working website I called this location as a second option. I clearly gave her my EXACT address and she said it would be about 40 minutes. Well over 30 minutes goes by and I get a call to clarify the address. When I repeat the address she says oh I thought you said. ....  .... this. Her mistake as I respeated the address numerous times and she said I was very close. Across the street actually. Now I should also mention I'm from out of town and visiting. So now she gives me major attitude because of her mistake and says I've called the wrong store and that my order isn't coming. So I proceed to tell her she should have told me this over a half hour ago. With this she slams down the phone and hangs up. No apology or I'm sorry i screwed up etc etc.  Totally fckn rude. This employee should be fired immediately. She has zero skills and zero manners and should get ZERO stars. An hour wasted of my life ordering GMO trash I'll never get back.  Nasty nasty nasty fast food trash attitude. F U hungry howies.

"Bin X.Charlotte, NC0412/5/2014worst dental experience so far. The doc was very rough, spilling anesthetic all over the mouth. Overselling a second root canal on a good tooth even I was referred by my own dentist for one single root canal only. He then turned around charged $79 for the ""inspection""Useful 13FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationRamesh S.Business Owner12/12/2014Dear Mr. Bin X.,I am really sorry that you had a bad experience in my office.  Honestly, I don't recall if I had ever deliberately ""spilled anesthetics all over"" my patients mouth. If it happened with you then it must have been an accidental and I sincerely apologize for that.  Is it possible that you tasted the topical anesthetic that we rub on the area before injection? Sometimes patients confuse topical anesthetic with real anesthetics as both have a similar and bitter taste. For the readers of this review by Mr. Bin X,  I would like to clarify that I do not oversell anything. I don't have to because most of my patients are referred from other dentists. If I see something that I think would prevent future problems then I will certainly recommend treatments but getting treatments on these recommendations is patient's decisions.  I believe not informing or educating patients of their problems specially if you have identified it is a disservice. As far as charging for x-ray and consultation is concerned it is a standard practice that every specialist do because we do spend time with the patient examining and evaluating. We do not accept an x-ray or evaluation of a referring dentist because of medical-legal reasons. Reevaluating a referred patients problems is a standard of care which even insurance companies are more than willing to reimburse specialists.  I hope this explanation clarifies any confusion created by Mr. Bin X's review about me or my office.Read more","Business owner informationRamesh S.Business Owner12/12/2014Dear Mr. Bin X.,I am really sorry that you had a bad experience in my office.  Honestly, I don't recall if I had ever deliberately ""spilled anesthetics all over"" my patients mouth.

"Michelle P.Las Vegas, NV23351410/6/2018Updated reviewRegrettably, I have to update this review as I'm not at all happy with the outcome of my healed treatment. I will preface this by saying I adhered to all aftercare instructions provided by Julia, and was communicative with her when I started to notice unpleasant results.After I had my first microneedling treatment with Julia, about a week following my healing, I noticed a dark patch develop on my skin. I was a little alarmed, so I snapped some pictures and texted Julia describing what I saw. She asked me to keep an eye on it, and if it didn't go away to let her know. By my 2nd treatment, the dark spot had faded. Now, Julia did not seem to have any reservations or concerns about treating me a second time, and we proceeded with the treatment.I texted Julia again - about a week after my treatment - alarmed because I had a dark, scaly patch that had developed on my neck. It was the same song and dance - don't worry about it, the neck takes longer to heal, keep an eye on it and let me know.This is now several weeks after my treatment and the dark patch is there. I have another dark patch on the other side of my neck as well. On top of all of this, I'm NEVER the type to break out in cystic acne, and following my second treatment, I was greeted by 4 or so very large, painful cystic pimples around my chin and jawline. All of which are causing ADDITIONAL scarring and unsightliness - exactly the opposite of the outcome I am looking for. I went to see a professional (who shall remain nameless for now) to get a second opinion on what I'm experiencing, and it appears that I have developed some hyperpigmentation and possibly SCARRING as a result of this treatment. Said professional agreed that following the initial red flag of my first treatment, Julia should have advised against treating me again. Before doing this, I reached out to Julia with my concerns and was met with defensiveness and excuses. She offered to provide me with a skin lightening cream, but I would have to pay an additional $100 due to it being a prescription or something of that nature. She refused to accept responsibility for her lapse in judgement, and emphasized that ""this is extremely rare"" and ""has NEVER happened"" with one of her patients. She later apologized for appearing to lack empathy in the situation.But above all, what is missing here is the glaring lack of responsibility for this outcome. If a client comes to you dissatisfied, you take ownership. Period. That's just good customer service. And what happened here was, I experienced a rare, adverse reaction to a treatment, and instead of advising against treating me again, she did it anyway. I spent almost $500 with Julia already to treat my face, and for her to deflect responsibility and ask me to pay MORE MONEY to fix this is just plain insulting. If it were my client, I would have offered a refund, additional resources or referrals, any sort of workaround, and do whatever it takes to make the situation RIGHT for the client - not further inconveniencing them by forking out more money for something that MIGHT work - as well as not taking ownership for the issue at hand. It's just not right. It's hard to admit when something didn't go as planned. Especially when you're a small business owner. And when you're a small business owner, it is even MORE important that your customer service is world class. I believe at the end of the day, Julia is a nice person and probably means well. I hope she learns from this mistake, and understands the importance of taking ownership. The last thing someone wants to hear when they are going through this is ""well I've never had this happen before - but here you can buy this cream!"" Well, I won't be buying your cream, but I will be updating my review. Apologies in advance.Useful 2FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationJulia H.Business Owner10/29/2018I am so sorry that you had such an unfortunate reaction to microneedling and I would really appreciate the opportunity to see it in person. It’s very rare to hyperpigment however, it is a listed side effect. Microneedling is a form of controlled inflammation that stimulates skin regeneration. Sometimes this inflammation masks itself as pigment during the healing process, especially in darker skin types. Fortunately, it’s not permanent. Acne is a more common side effect and microneedling can cause breakouts even in the clearest of skin. Everyone’s skin is different and even though I can make assessments for treatment based on your skin type, I cannot guarantee any outcome. Whether you went to me for microneedling or someone else, you would’ve had the same reaction. I understand that this is not only frustrating but scary. I have and will continue to offer you any of my services to help speed healing and ease your worries.Read more7/16/2018Previous reviewJulia is an angel! When I came in for my consultation a few weeks ago, she took her time providing me with a ton of information and answered all of my (many) questions. Julia is so incredibly knowledgeable and sweet, she treated me as if she had known me forever!The procedure I had done was microneedling. She suggested this as one of the many treatments I would benefit from to help reduce my acne scars and dark spots. I didn't know much about the procedure at all, and Julia did an incredible job making sure I was comfortable. The procedure was a little uncomfortable at times, but overall wasn't bad at all! After the procedure, she gave me all the information I needed for aftercare, and I was on my way.I'm thrilled with my experience and treatment from Julia and I can't wait to return! I'm so excited for my results, but most importantly, I'm so lucky to have found her!Read more","Business owner informationJulia H.Business Owner10/29/2018I am so sorry that you had such an unfortunate reaction to microneedling and I would really appreciate the opportunity to see it in person.

"Barbara M.Phoenix, AZ4137/21/2019I am surprised at other reviews as I had a totally amazing experience renting through Advantage.We flew into Phoenix under military orders and was almost 18 hours late from our reservation. We arrived at the counter around 7AM and there was no line. Check in was quick and Luis was very kind explaining optional coverages and patiently answering all my questions. They were out of the car type we booked but that wasn't a problem for us as an alternate was offered. We went down stairs to pick up the vehicle and that was super simple too. Got the keys,  we were able to take our time inspecting it and getting familiar with it before driving out of the lot. As Advantage was substantially cheaper than other car rental companies I was expecting an older vehicle with no features but I was completely wrong.  We got a 2018 Chrysler Pacific and I absolutely loved it.  So many features for a great price. Return was a breeze. There was some construction so a little tricky finding the Advantage return area but followed the signs and got there.  I was alone with my two kids and a little frazzled,  Imad came right up  at car drop off, took the time to say hi and very friendly as well. He took the keys,  reviewed my total charges, and we were done! Super simple process.  I received my $200 deposit back on my credit card 2 days later.I truly had a great experience and will use them next time I need a rental car!UsefulFunny 1CoolBusiness owner informationYumarilis B.Business Owner7/23/2019Thank you for your review Barbara.Read more",Business owner informationYumarilis B.Business Owner7/23/2019Thank you for your review Barbara.Read more

"Nick S.Gresham, OR1412/22/2019Reserved a car through Priceline that went through this company. Handed Tom at the counter my ID and CC when asked. The address sticker on my ID was worn, so after showing it to his manager in the back, told me they couldn't accept it. Umm... why not? ""Because we can't read this sticker"" Okay. I removed the sticker revealing my old address perfectly readable. They still would not accept my perfectly valid, unexpired Oregon ID. Tom obviously has a chip on his shoulder and apparently just didn't want to rent me a car I had already paid for. Went next door and had a much more pleasant experience with Alamo.

"Shauna M.Elite '2021Portland, OR2143647553/23/2018I assume the only reason people rent from here is because they are booking through a discount travel site and have no idea what they are getting into. Everything about the rental experience was a fail. Everyone working was acting like they had never done their jobs before in their lives. It took us over an hour of waiting in line just to get to the reservation counter. On a Sunday afternoon.I also really loved the attempted up-sale at the counter when the woman working tried to convince us that there was no way three women with carry on luggage were never going to fit in the full size sedan we rented. Sure lady. That car was bigger than we needed and she made it sound like we had rented a Miata.If anything this experience will always make me think twice before blindly renting a car through a travel site.

"Riddhi L.Phoenix, AZ023/18/2019We scheduled our move really 3 days in advance and Pearson Moving accommodated that, plus I started getting text alerts and that was helpful.The best part of the move was our crew - Kaden, Jermey, Sefton, these guys were amazing, professional, polite and were accommodating to our needs. We got done in about 5-6 hours, and the move went peacefully and smoothly without any hiccups or broken pieces etc. They carefully wrapped our big pieces with blankets and cling wrap.Bottom line - We are very satisfied with our move and highly recommend them.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationKyle P.Business Owner3/18/2019Hi Riddhi!

"William W.Pittsburgh, PA032/3/2012First to ReviewGave this place a number of tries. I have bought two turntables here and one cheap receiver. The receiver broke literally the moment I plugged it in. No big deal it cost around $15-20 and was very low end. Two other turntables I bought stopped working within a month of purchase...not belts...not needles, these were replaced and they still do not function. When I bought the last one I asked what his return policy was because of my previous issues...he sort of chuckled and just assured me it worked. I got burned three times and I will not be back.

She said she hadn't been to 18 degrees since the renovations and I've never been at all so we checked it out. Got there around 12:30pm on a Sunday and got sat outside right away (our preference outside since it was nice out).The staff were super friendly. Some tables outside had umbrellas and other tables did not. Some had double umbrellas so we asked for it to be moved by us so we got some shade and they totally accommodated which was great.Their mimosa and Bloody Mary was delicious and definitely not a let down. The Bloody Mary was definitely spicy just how I like it.The food was cooked perfectly. When I get hash browns I always ask for it to be burnt so that it is crispy and most places just burn the top and call it a day. They actually fried all of it and it was awesome. Bacon was crispy and the scrambled eggs weren't runny. The grapefruit had a top that was caramel used which I thought was clever since it added to the taste.Definitely a good spot to go to for a good brunch.Breakfast!UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationKevin B.Business Manager4/1/2019Thank you so much!

"Kay M.Phoenix, AZ142344/3/20196 photosSome colleagues from PA and NC were in town, so we decided to have our team outing here. When you first walk up and into the restaurant, it seemed like a really cool casual spot for a date night or happy hour with your friends. The patio area was really chill. The food smelled sooo good as we all walked in. We had a party of 17 and were seated right across from the ice rink.There was a guy working on the gate that separates the ice rink check in area from the dining area. It was loud pounding and rattling and it seemed like an inappropriate time to do this during the lunch rush.The waitress was attentive at the beginning. She took our drink & food orders and then we didn't see her until half of the table was finished eating. Several different people brought us our food but the food came out in strange batches (which I get for a party of 17, but we had to remind them about one of my colleagues' order.)My colleague and I both ordered the Chilaquiles Bennie with a side of loaded hash. BOTH of our dishes did not come out with what the description says. Her plate was missing the black bean puree and my plate was missing the black bean puree and the hollandaise crema. Another colleague was missing all of the toppings on her order of loaded hash.Overall, the team did not like the experience and came to the consensus that we will not return to this location. Personally, I'll come back to ice skate but will not be dining here again either. Really wish the experience went differently.See all photos from Kay M. for 18 DegreesUseful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationKevin B.Business Manager4/5/2019We apologize that you had a bad experience!

"Scott B.Berea, OH5335/22/2017Used Travel Leaders for my Honeymoon to Maui. Great resort, however there was an issue with our flight and we lost the first day in Maui. We let our travel agent know and she said that she would take care of it when we got back. I expected something fairly significant as this was a trip of a lifetime. All she got back for us was two $75 vouchers with the airline. Not a huge deal but disappointing. We still had a great time. About 6 months later we decided to take a cruise as we've never been on one. I requested options with reasonable budget as we spent a large amount on the previous trip. She emailed me back once and said that it was not possible to find one on our budget. I then requested what our options were at a higher price and she never got back to me. Searching on my own I found plenty of cruises in my budget range. I guess unless you're spending the equivalent to the down payment on a house that you don't matter to these people.Useful 1Funny 1Cool 1Business owner informationKim G.Business Owner5/23/2017Hello, ScottLet me assure you that we do everything we can to get you a vacation within your budget, no matter what that budget may be.

"Lisa C.Elite '2021Markham, Canada8985579/16/20191 photoWhile the consultation and booking process were satisfactory, I cannot say the same for the actual hair treatment itself. With an unsatisfactory end result and a disappointing lack of follow up, it's ultimately a let down. I dropped in on a Sunday morning for a consultation with Bosco of what I was looking for, and was able to book an appointment for the following Sunday, which was great. They were highly communicative and looked to resolve any confusion, which I can appreciate. However, it went all down hill from there. Walking in, I already had a clear idea of what I wanted. We discussed this in the consultation session, and I had a picture that I shared as a reference as well. I emphasized that I would like ash brown/grey highlights with contrasts as apparent as my previous existing dye and it sounded like the stylist knew what I wanted. When the bleaching part was complete, I was quite happy about how the contrast came out. Then came the coloring part. I emphasized again that I would like the streak effects, and wanted to see the grey-blonde end result. However, she kept insisting that a darker tone would look better, and assured me that despite the darkness, it would still look contrasting. She even said that she would leave the dye in for 15 minutes only so it wouldn't turn that dark. I was unconvinced, but decided to lay my trust in her, as she was the ""professional."" Contrary to the 15 minutes that she said, I was left there to wait for 30 minutes while she went to cut another client's hair. After 30 minutes, I was escorted to wash the dye out of my hair. Unsurprisingly by that point, it was difficult for me to see any apparent contrast. I was trying to be patient and waited until it was completely dry - but again to my disappointment, it was much darker than I asked for, and it was simply grey & brown all over and there was no apparent contrast to be found. All this took 6 hours.I told the stylist I was quite disappointed with the result. Instead of trying to fix the problem, she suggested options of how I could fix it myself later at home if I didn't like it, and that I should have told her what I wanted earlier (which I did via the consultation and photo,) and she would have chosen a different colour. Lastly, she suggested I wash my hair more often for the dye to come out and make it less dark. To have to drop $440 (which was more than what was quoted in the consultation,) and to have to sit for 6 whole hours only to walk out with a disappointing result leaves a very sour taste in my mouth. Telling the client to go fix it yourself at home instead of taking accountability for what they did is also a big issue. With the amount of time and money spent here for a disappointing result and a complete lack of accountability on the stylist's part, I would not recommend this place as a customer.Top Left: expectation // Top Right: after it was accidentally washed after bleach // Bottom: final product of $400 + tips with BoscoUseful 11Funny 1Cool 1Business owner informationJBon H.Business Owner1/17/2020Hi Lisa,We're sorry you had an disappointing experience.

It's more refreshing than the other flavours and you won't end up with a gain headache.Don't purchase extra charcoal.

"Norm C.Kanata, Canada05815/2/2018We reciently had to move a few items from a storage facility in Toronto to Ottawa.  We debated renting a truck ourselves and doing the work versus hiring movers.  As one item that had to be moved was a piano, we chose movers.  A quick google gave us Rent-a-Son.  We hired them and it was not a mistake.  I was lucky to have Amanda and my moving coordinator and she set everything up for me.  She was helpful and was able to work with our schedule.   The team that arrived in Toronto were on time, polite, professional and took extra care with our items.  The team that delivered to us in Ottawa were again right on time, polite and professional.  Everything arrived, undamaged.  All I can say is thank you to Amanda for setting this all up and a thank you to both moving teams for their hard work!  I would recommend them to anyone!Useful 2Funny 1Cool 1Business owner informationPatrick H.Business Owner7/24/2018Hi Norm, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback after a long Move!  Your movers appreciate it.  Goodluck settling in!Read more","Business owner informationPatrick H.Business Owner7/24/2018Hi Norm, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback after a long Move!  Your movers appreciate it.  Goodluck settling in!Read more"
"Aqeela N.Toronto, Canada22231/11/2016I decided to try out a new moving company for my most recent move. Rent-a-Son had such a high rating and so many good reviews on HomeStars, I was initially suspicious about who wrote them. That being said, there were barely any negative reviews (and they weren't even that bad) so I felt comfortable trying out the company. After my experience, I can completely understand why there are hundreds of 10/10 reviews.Amanda coordinated the move and was really personable and helpful. Likewise, the two movers who showed up the day of the move were amazing. They were extremely efficient, energetic, and had positive attitudes. Plus, they ensured all my furniture were protected with blankets, and they even put down runners so they wouldn't track dirt into my place.The experience was a huge difference from the move prior, and I am so glad I decided to hire this company.Useful 14Funny 9Cool 8Business owner informationPatrick H.Business Owner11/7/2016Thank you so much for the feedback!  We are so happy that you were able to settle into your new home nicely -AmandaRead more",Business owner informationPatrick H.Business Owner11/7/2016Thank you so much for the feedback!  We are so happy that you were able to settle into your new home nicely -AmandaRead more
"Stone C.Toronto, Canada011/18/2017I've moved several times and I haven't had much luck with movers.  I chose Rent-a-Son based on comparison reviews with other moving companies yet I still wasn't very hopeful based on my experience.  I am glad I did the research and I'm glad I chose them.  The process is detailed and the assessments are necessary as they make a difference to the move.  You come to appreciate the care they take in preview when that care is represented with your belongings on the day of the move. I had to move a 3 bdrm townhouse into storage and the 3 ""sons"" made quick work of the sometimes complicated job.  There were no real surprises and I was rebated a portion of my payment without issue for an excess in estimation.  I am using them for a second time with confidence this year.  The service is friendly and efficient.

"Karyn L.Tempe, AZ22691/30/2015BEWARE!!!Can Brian and his crew lay beautiful tile and hard wood? YES! No doubt. BUT....in the process, you will wish you had opted for a better contractor. Because if it's like my house; your kitchen cabinets that were in perfect condition originally will be MAJORLY damaged after. Brian's response ""we can't we reposible for the damage our tools do when tearing up tile."" They didn't try to cover, pad or offer any protection to minimize the potential for damage. Baseboards? We thought we would reuse the originals, which were in good condition. Brian supported this. And Brian quoted for tear down and replacement of the original baseboards. Ha! Brian put them back up like a damaged puzzle. Pieces were broken and glued back together, edges in wrong spots. I had to buy new baseboards and hire someone to repair them. The toilet previously functioned correctly, but after Brian removed the toilet to retile the bathroom, he wasn't able to replace the toilet without a leak, so he re-removed and text me to buy a new toilet. He scratched up my front door by scraping old tile and trash across the door as full hands passed through. And while the floors look great, he messed up the transitions. Not pretty. I'll have to pay $250 for new transitions and labor of another contractor to do it right. This 3 day project spanned 3 weeks. Aside from 3 days of delay in supplies, no fault to Brian, this project just drug on far far longer than needed. And to make matters worse, Brian broke into my house after the work was complete! I changed the house codes 1/23, as he'd stated that day he would be complete work. I don't keep contractor codes around any longer than needed for security. Saturday I noticed someone had been in my house. He freely admits it was him, but swears he used his code. He didn't have authority to be there, and I know he broke in through the back. Brian also, multiple times during the project, yelled, belittled, and called me names.Don't hire this guy (check him out online first, he lost his license previously....it might happen again, and he changes his biz name so no catches on quickly.)UPDATE 2016 - Brian agreed at the completion of service to take off $1k for damages. Not nearly enough to cover what the damages cost, but we met in the middle. After signing the agreement that the final check, less $1000 was paid in full, he sued me for that money.  After reassessing the full cost of damages, including the floor which is now coming up, because he apparently forgot to use glue?!?!? We countersued. Tens of thousands in damages excluding legal fees. The court case is ongoing, his suit was dismissed by the court. Ours still pending. I hope he loses his contractors license (again) and can't ever mess someone's home up like ours is.Useful 4FunnyCool 1Business owner informationBrian B.Business Owner6/9/2017UPDATE 2017 CASE WAS RESOLVED IN A TRIAL SEVERAL MONTHS AGO AND SHOWING NO FAULT TO BCT FLOORING AND SHOWERSRead more",Business owner informationBrian B.Business Owner6/9/2017UPDATE 2017 CASE WAS RESOLVED IN A TRIAL SEVERAL MONTHS AGO AND SHOWING NO FAULT TO BCT FLOORING AND SHOWERSRead more

For those of you who have not had the pleasure, these tarts consist of a sweet creamy custard nestled within a crispy flaky pastry shell - heavenly!  I couldn't leave without grabbing at least a dozen! The girls serving at the counter are very courteous - I asked to pick out my natas as I like them more browned/burnt on the top and she kindly agreed.

Delicious juicy chicken, fries and salad served with a hot or a mild sauce. The setting is not fancy, but it's cheap, delicious and generous.I tied this classic Portuguese Rotisserie when we went to Montreal last year. There was a long line up, it took me more than 1 hr to get to the ordering counter. There are 2 lines, one for walk in and second for order pickup. Yes you can order in advance and skip the long line. I got it packed and also got few egg tarts. Went back to our hotel and ate it after 2 hrs. I was blown away, the chicken was so flavourful and juicy. Even the egg tarts were good. I will definitely go back there.

"Bob V.Lakewood, OH13212/19/20192 photosOn July 17 my iPod stopped working and after a brief telephone conversation with Rick I brought it to him for repairs, intact and in original packaging.I was pleasantly surprised to hear from him the very next day. He told me that he had fixed the unit and it would cost $140. I picked it up from him that evening on my way to my girlfriend's house. I gave him $160 in cash, tipping him $20 for his quick turnaround time.He took it out of the box and demonstrated that it turned on, the backlight lit. I wasn't able to test its ability to play music because I didn't have earphones with me but I was planning on testing it out in my car. Unfortunately in the 45 seconds it took for me to reach my car the iPod's battery had gone critical and died. I certainly didn't think I'd need a charger while picking the unit up so I didn't have one on me. I thought it was odd that the battery died but figured I'd charge it when I got home later, after visiting my girlfriend. When I got home and charged it overnight it still wasn't working so I called Rick to complain. He already had my cash so I was obligated to give him another opportunity to repair the unit. I brought it back to him, along with another identical iPod to use for parts if needed. Both iPods were intact and in original packaging. Rick kept asking for more time to complete repairs. I relented until I had waited for four full months for my iPods to be returned to me. On November 17 I told him I was tired of waiting for his repairs and wanted to pick up my iPods. Despite my giving him several days to get my iPods reassembled, he returned my two intact iPods to me as a sack of unassembled parts, without all of the original packaging. Worse yet, Rick left a random unassociated memory card in the sack of parts which contains the personal medical information of a stranger.   So I gave Rick two intact iPods and $160, four months later he gave me back a sack of unassembled parts, and a hearty ""sorry!"". The idea of any refund at all (not even the tip I paid him) was immediately rejected by Rick.What I got back from Rick.

He had 2 Ipod classis boxes with various memory cards in the boxes.

A couple more months go by and I don't hear from Bob.Then Bob shows up very jumpy and moving all over the place and wanted to pick up Ipods and I explained to him per our conversation he was to pick up a compatible Ipod. He seemed to forget our converstion and he just wanted to try to fix himself and I explained to Bob they are very difficult to work on and that I could put them back together for 35.00 and refund the rest. He explained he lost his job and needed to give his girlfriend the money so they didn't get evicted.

"Kathleen R.San Francisco, CA10583/18/2021Worst bank I've ever banked at in all my lifetime. Absolutely no follow up ! No support! Lazy , inefficient and no one knows their position.

"Alex R.Bozeman, MT044/15/2019Truly awful customer service. Do not do business here or at any U.S. Bank for that matter. They do not care and will cause frustration at every step. I have been trying for over a month to make a very simple change to my account and no can seem to get it done. The manager at the branch, Carlos, was extremely unhelpful, and in the middle of this went on vacation with no warning to me. Now I am stuck and will have to start the whole process over when he returns. I was told many times that I would be called back or sent a conformation. They never do and I'm the one who has to call back or remind them to send the thing they said they would. I will never do business with U.S. Bank again. Such a joke.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationUS B.Business Owner4/15/2019Good afternoon Alex, I'm so sorry to hear that you've been working on a change for so long, and that this process has caused you so much frustration.

"Micki M.Elite '2021Sacramento, CA49876567769/7/2016This was our first time using Showtime for our transfer to/from the airport. We pre purchased our tickets online and had our tickets printed. When we arrived at the airport, the Showtime pick up location was easy to find outside the doors. Our shuttle arrived in minutes. The transfer to our hotel did take some time. We got on this small sized bus. Our driver loaded lots of other travelers and I would say the process of loading and checking other passengers took about fifteen minutes. Once passengers were loaded, our driver took us to our destination. We chose the MGM on this trip and luckily, we were the first stop. When going from hotel to airport, we were among maybe a few people going to the airport. We went directly from our hotel there!

We arrived late at night on a Friday night.  There was a 30 minute way for the taxis, so we thought a shuttle service may be faster.  Showtime looked as though they had the most shuttles so we decided to go with them. We first inquired about their limo/car service but the lady said she couldn't give us pricing on that because they don't take care of that at her station. Yet they advertise it right at the front of her booth?!?!?!

"Holly H.Phoenix, AZ3652/6/2019We knew when we bought our house a couple of years ago that the HVAC unit (original to the house built in 1998) was on borrowed time. So, of course, the heater kicks the bucket on the one ""cold"" weekend we have here in Phoenix...and why not the same weekend as we have family in town from the polar-vortexed midwest?Have no fear - Scottsdale Air is here! We called on Thursday afternoon and had a technician out (ON TIME) at 8:00 am the next day. Dave was professional, pleasant and HONEST about the most cost-effective way to move forward. We agreed it would be cheaper to just replace the whole thing and he had a sales rep at our house that afternoon. Russ Byrum (sales rep) is the most patient man on the planet. My husband and I are first time homebuyers and we had no idea what we were doing. Russ laid everything out for us and didn't try to oversell us beyond our budget. This dude is a ROCK STAR and will not steer you wrong. By Tuesday, we had the AMAZING install team at our house (Please note: they were ready to come out on Saturday, but we couldn't make it work on our end before that because of work. Russ even offered to bring out space heaters to our home so we didn't freeze over the weekend).Picture this: our HVAC system is half-outside/half-in-an-attic-crawl-space-in-a-garage that doesn't look like a human being should be able to fit in there. I don't know anything about this stuff and even I could tell you this task looked impossible. But for Jaime and Eulogio? No problem. They worked quickly, quietly and CLEANLY - wrapping the whole project in about seven hours. It was AMAZING. I cannot describe how much respect I have for these two guys. THANK YOU.Bottom Line: while this is the first time I've had the opportunity to use this company's services, my uncle and parents have been using them for decades; now they've earned one more lifelong customer.

Turns out they entered the wrong pickup time- a half hour later than what I said. They offered to put the order in immediately with a ten minute wait. (No apology.) I waited, and received it in ten minutes. Brought it home (a two minute drive), and discovered that the breadsticks were overdone and cold- could have used them for a chisel. Wrong sauce.

"Jill S.Gilbert, AZ40832115/18/2021Precision Air & Plumbing came to our rescue after waiting for AC repair service from our home warranty for almost two, long hot weeks. We ultimately made the decision to replace our existing AC units on a Monday morning; PA was out that same day with an extremely competitive quote,  including a generous first responder discount, and were able to install the 2 new units the following day. The team of 4 showed up on time, were professional, personable and finished the job in one day as promised. They even vacuumed when they were finished - that made the OCD side of my brain extremely happy - which was a close second to having cool air again.

"Steve G.Scottsdale, AZ61713/16/20211 photoWe used Precision Air and Plumbing for a few years with good results. However in recent times we have had serious issues with them. We have uncommonly hard water and they had us remove our softener and. replace it with another technology which did not do what they described and caused scaling damage. They took back the new unit but charged us to purchase and install a new replacement softener. I received no response when trying to reach out to Managment about rectifying this.We gave them another chance when we had a leak caused by a hot water heater and humidifier hoping we could offset the cost of the softener debacle. Scheduling was a nightmare, they made a huge mess on our patio and although promising to clean it up multiple times still never did. I was in direct touch with service Managment and it still took weeks to get them out here to finish, and, the work area was left in a big mess inside the houseWe longer will be working with them------The business owner commented below but Yelp does not show a way for me to reply.

But that's not why I keep going back...Jessica is one of the most talented stylists that have ever had the benefit of working with.  Thorough, patient, strong vision: she is simply amazing.  She also has a great gift of gab which makes the time just fly by while I'm in her chair.  I go back every two weeks, getting my beard trimmed at that frequency then my full haircut once a month.Well worth a trip even if you have to go a few miles out of your way.

"Amy T.Elite '2021San Francisco, CA1230371387811/18/20161 photoI purchased a Groupon for a two hour deep tissue massage with 3 additional services. The three I chose were the back scrub, foot scrub, and the hot stones. My massage was with Ariana at 4PM. The confirmation email she sent out included step-by-step instructions on how to get to the exact location. Thank goodness for her instructions because I would've gotten lost otherwise. Ariana met me at the front desk exactly at 4. She gave me a questionnaire to fill out regarding my health status, my preference of pressure, and the issue areas that I wanted her to address. The pressure scale was anywhere from 1 to 8, 8 being ""it hurts so good."" I have gotten my fair square of professional massages so I opted for a 7.5. The room was clean and Ariana was very professional. However, I was thoroughly disappointed with my massage and 3 additional services. First of all, I asked for a 7.5 pressure, Ariana gave me about a 2/3. I understand that pressure is a subjective topic, but she never asked if the pressure was okay (not even once). She spent what seemed like hours on my back as I had pointed out in the beginning that my problem spots were my shoulders and lower back. She used the same strokes repeatedly; there was no variation. I got bored quickly. Because she did not massage deeply, she glided over my knots. It was more like a petting zoo than a deep tissue massage. I left feeling the same amount of tenseness in my shoulders and lower back as I had came with, but with a lot more residual oil from head to toe. When she flipped me onto my back, she went to go massage my abdominal area which felt weird to me. I've never had my abs massaged before and because I don't have abs, I felt as if she was massaging my organs. 2 out of the 3 additional add-ons were also disappointing. The hot stones was my favorite because you cant really mess up on rubbing hot stones across ones back. However, the foot and back scrub didn't do much for me. Oil is placed across the back and feet and a what felt like a scrub mit was used to gently glide across the skin. There was no pressure at all. It didn't feel like a scrub. I was hoping to find a masseuse that I could see monthly, but unfortunately, that didn't happen. I thoroughly appreciated Ariana's level of professionalism and the cleanliness of the facility, but she lacked skill.Waiting areaUseful 3Funny 2Cool 1Business owner informationAriana L.Business Owner11/20/2016Oh darn, every licensed massage therapist knows the day will come when they'll get a bad review...but you are never really ready for it! Especially not being compared to a Petting Zoo :)  I appreciate your very thorough review.In regards to pressure: I provide very light to very deep tissue massage. I try my best to empower clients to be in the driver's seat of their massage, letting them know they can request more or less at any time. Usually with a 2 hour session, a full hour is spent on the back if those areas are the client's chief complaint. One size doesn't fit all for clients when it comes to pressure or technique, which is why I try my best to keep the lines of communication open, while not interrupting your time on the table with needless additional chatter. I sincerely apologize if I didn't communicate this effectively and will be much more careful about it in the future. In regards to technique: Every therapist isn't right for every person and it sounds like we might not have been a match made in heaven. :) My techniques are diverse, and I use additional long flowing connected strokes to give the massage that flowy ""omm"" feeling. This helps those really deep massages to feel more relaxing, and reduces the chances that the client will be sore the next day. The techniques I use are meant for a deeply effective relaxation based massage which relieves stress, muscular tension and soreness. My hope is that my clients' minds will be able to relax just as well as their bodies. Now and Zen is a great choice for relaxing style deep tissue massage, but would not be a good choice for a fast paced, sports-style deep tissue massage. In regards to the relaxation exfoliation shea butter scrubs: I appreciate your feedback. These menu items were created as a more gentle/relaxing and less messy alternative to traditional salt and sugar scrubs. Warm shea butter is massaged over the back and then exfoliation mitts are used to gently exfoliate the skin, afterwards steamed towels are used to wipe away excess butter and add a little moisture. This additional moisture allows the vitamin rich butter to penetrate the skin more deeply. In regards to the abdominal massage: I sincerely apologize for massaging an area that was uncomfortable. I try my best for a very thorough intake. I think it is important to note here that even if abdominal muscles aren't highly toned (like traditional ""abs"" you see in magazines) that they are still there and still in use each and every day. They are quite tense on most individuals regardless of muscle tone or weight and are often overlooked in treatment. Working attachment points for these muscles gently over the sheet can ease a lot of tension in the back for most people, especially lower back tension or that ""stuck"" feeling in the mid-back around the thoracic spine. But there are definitely exceptions and massage isn't ever one-size-fits-all, which is part of what makes it such a beautiful art! Sometimes life is about learning what we don't want, just as much as learning what we do :) Now that we know it is something you don't like, in the future you can let your next therapist know that they can avoid that area. Additionally,  if they are doing anything to make you feel uncomfortable at all, please know you have the right to ask them to stop or adjust their technique at any time and for any reason. We never want you to be uncomfortable on our tables. You will never be asked for an explanation or receive resistance from a professional therapist - we are here to serve you and your preferences are paramount to us.

Sorry!Read more7/17/2018Previous reviewWhat a horrible company. We had an insurance claim where the insurance company agreed to pay AZ Family Dentistry due to an injury. We had AZ Family Dentistry replace a crown. While many dentists can replace a crown in a day, AZ Dentistry put in a temporary crown while we waited 5 weeks for the permanent crown to come in. During this process the temporary crown fell out twice! After finally receiving the permanent crown, it fell out after a week! Clearly, someone doesn't know what they're doing. Fast forward a few weeks. We are still negotiating a settlement with the insurance and receive a voicemail from Peggy that she will be calling the police on us and filing a claim for theft of goods and services. How unprofessional. They were aware this was an insurance claim and she even spoke to the insurance company to verify before working on us. I'm not sure how the insurance company and us working on a settlement is stealing from her. Lastly, when I called to discuss the horrible voicemail she left us, she yelled at me and hung up.

"Mark R.Gimli, Canada0913/26/2019My Indochino suit material quality is good. I am happy with the product itself but that is the only part of the experience that was satisfactory. The process of getting the suit and getting measured for adjustments is incredibly cumbersome and not user friendly at all. You'll have a much more satisfying experience if you go to any mainstream suit retailer. Their website is very misleading as to their ability to deliver on their promise and timelines. You need to budget 1-2 months to get a proper fitting suit with all the adjustments and remakes required. They seem completely unwilling to compensate clients for the inconvenience of their process. I am guessing that's why all orders are non-refundable. If they were refundable no one would follow through with their order. I will not be ordering from Indochino again. The product is satisfactory but it's not any better than the next tailor and therefore not worth the long and inconvenient process. You'll have a much more enjoyable experience getting a ""custom"" tailored suit from your local tailor or merchant (such as Moore's or Men's Warehouse or Tip Top Tailor)I gave them multiple opportunities to make up for the dropped ball service but they did not care to try. They could have kept my future business if they'd tried to do so.

"PJ K.Elite '2021Richmond Hill, Canada21181453/17/2016Don't be fooled, investing in a made-to-measure suit (a.k.a. custom suit) is not the same as investing in a bespoke suitThe truth is that made-to-measure suits still conform to a design template being mass-produced by a company to make its sales.Brands that offer made-to-measure suits have made the process a fairly easy and a quick one for all types of men. Measurements taken by a consultant or calculated by an online tailoring system are sent off to a factory machine that is programmed to know basic proportions. In a matter of days, the suit is ready for wear. If additional alterations are required, they might be done on site, but these days little or no hand-made elements are incorporated into the assembly of a made-to-measure suit.Ultimately, the effort in creating a suit that is unique to a single wearer is lost in the made-to-measure process. The one-on-one consultations between client and tailor are compromised to simply submitting measurements, picking a lining, choosing some buttons and possibly having the suit monogrammed. Other than that, you end up with a swatch that has been customized to fit you in the best way it can.There is nothing wrong with purchasing a made-to measure suit and here are a few pros:- Affordable- Personalized- StylishI ordered a 'made to measure suit' from Indochino last year and here is my experience with this company.The consultant was friendly and knowledgeable about the products. The process begins with selecting a material, buttons, a lining, a suit jacket style (i.e single or double breasted), notch style, vent, etc. They than proceeded to take my measurements which is also available online through the website. In the end, I was happy with my experience and was anxious to receive my suit which they shipped directly to my home.Unfortunately when I did receive my suit, the suit length was cut so short it looked like I was wearing a toddlers jacket. There was a few other minor issues, sleeve length and pant length but I chalk this up to inexperience from the consultant. Indochino, at no extra cost, had the minor issues tailored and replaced the jacket with a properly measure jacket.Overall, if you are a first timer looking to have a 'made to measure' suit or 'custom suit' made, I would recommend Indochino.Useful 13Funny 1CoolBusiness owner informationChris T.Business Manager3/29/2016Pat, Thanks for taking the time to write a such an informative and refreshing review.  I'm glad that in the end we got your fit right, but please feel free to reach out if you ever need anything else.Warm regards,Josesocial@indochino.comRead more","Business owner informationChris T.Business Manager3/29/2016Pat, Thanks for taking the time to write a such an informative and refreshing review.  I'm glad that in the end we got your fit right, but please feel free to reach out if you ever need anything else.Warm regards,Josesocial@indochino.comRead more"

She just finished stocking pepperoni and I don't want that in my food. (This is not the first time I have asked this at a pizza place and most people don't care) The pizza is super thin.

"Courtney L.Mesa, AZ05817310/25/20154 photosMy fiance and I came across a project pie in Vegas and fell in love with the concept, so when we saw this opened up right down the street from the house we were all over it.The owner was holding the door to greet customers which was very nice customer service he explained the concept him and his wife decided to implement into the restaurant and thanked us for coming. All the employees were very nice and the inside was decorated perfectly. Since it is new there was a lot of people and limited seating (understanable). I am a plain pizza person so I only get pepperoni and my fiance gets meat lovers, he enjoyed his pizza although for myself it came out soggy and floppy. I also noticed there was no corn mean on the dough.... To me that's what makes a pizza, also they use ovens like dominos or pizza hut would use instead of a fire oven or brick oven which changes the taste completely. It was good but I would drive further to another place with the same concept next time. It's a shame becuase I wanted to really like this place.Useful 3Funny 1Cool 3Business owner informationBecky M.Business Owner11/9/2015We took a lot of time to test out our pizzas, and we get the best finish on our crusts with the conveyor ovens, as opposed to the wood-fired ovens, which left us with unevenly cooked pizzas & even soggy crusts.

"Fred G.Cleveland, OH0851/17/2018Neubert painted my aluminum sided home some years ago. They employed college students on their summer break. I would never had hired them, knowing this. They did a terrible job, the finish was like sand paper because they always painted the side of the house in direct sun and the paint dried too quickly and they applied the paint ""too dry"". The owner blamed the PPG paint but only offered to refinish the front of the house. They missed areas and didn't paint behind downspouts.Next time, I will either paint it myself or make sure the painters are experienced painters.Useful 5FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationDon M.Business Owner1/18/2018We're sorry to hear your displeasure.

"Jayne Y.Elite '2021Las Vegas, NV66732262/13/20209 photosMichael Mina is a Michelin-star chef and well-known for his flagship restaurant in San Francisco. I had no idea who he was when I ate here, but my coworkers from San Francisco spoke highly of his food so I was excited to dine here.When we walked in, the ambiance felt inviting, relaxing and elegant. Our server was excellent...customer service was top-notch! There were 8 of us and he arranged for additional staff to help serve our party. They anticipated our needs and accommodated us throughout the entire time. The food was AMAZING!!! We all chose the Tasting Menu (6 course meal for $148 per person) to get the most out of our experience. Everything was delish, but here are a couple of standouts:Ahi Tuna- wow! The server said that they get the ahi from Hawaii. It's mixed with an egg yolk, sesame oil-based dressing and pine nuts. One of the servers will mix all of the ingredients for you. Lobster Pot Pie- decadent and delicious! The pieces of lobster were HUGE. It's mixed with brandied cream, black truffle and baby vegetables. We drank bottles of red and white wine to complement the various dishes (fish, red meat, etc.). They provided an excellent selection! The Goldeneye Pinot Noir was my favorite! Dining here is a splurge, but it's worth it. A handful of employees thanked us for coming in as we walked out the door....first-class service!

"Kristie P.Elite '2021New York, NY27022859910/21/20194 photosWas able to sneak away from work for dinner and we landed on Michael Mina, as it was easy to get a table and it wasn't too far from our hotel. You do have to walk through the crazy Vegas crowds to get to the restaurant, as it is nestled a bit inside of the Bellagio. We were seated right away and ordered a bottle of wine to start. We decided to do the summer tasting menu with the shellfish. Here's how it went:-First course - trio of raw and chilled: the hamachi was my favorite, then the snapper then the squid. The snapper did have some crispy scales that felt like I was biting into something I shouldn't be eating so I do wish they had removed that. Overall, very fresh and a good variety of flavors in the three -Second course - sweet corn gazpacho: man oh man, was this delicious! The gazpacho was fresh but very thick and full of rich crab. Third course - shellfish: everything you could want from this course. Fresh, flavorful, and light. The scallop was buttery, the oysters had the perfect amount of miso garlicy goodness smothered all over them, and there were some shrimp cocktail as well. -Fourth course - filet mignon: the steak was as good as you could expect but the real star of the show was the shallot-potato cake. It was super crispy and warm and I wish I could have that with my breakfast everyday. -Fifth course - chocolate cake: not gonna lie, I was not a fan of this at all. I honestly think beet tastes like dirt (LOL) so a sorbet out of beet isn't high on my list of foods I'd recommend. All in all, was just an okay experience. I think there are much better restaurants in Vegas for the same price tag.Useful 2Funny 1Cool 4Business owner informationJorge P.Business Manager10/24/2019Dear Kristie P.,Thank you for your feedback and 4 star review.

Lol We were registered for the 5:15 slot,  showed up on time, one of our team was running a little late and they were completely understanding of it and didn't have an issue.  Registering was super easy,  you pay and sign a waiver and you're all set.We did the ""easy"" room called Underworld.  We had a blast.  I won't talk about how to solve anything but we were a little thrown off in the beginning as the guy told us that we do not need to do anything crazy, break stuff etc.   so we were a little hesitant with some of the props in the room and this easily set us back as we were extremely  hard headed to ask for hints. Haha.   (The employees will give you 3 hints if you ask for them) Let me just tell you.... TOUCH AND MOVE EVERYTHING, LOOK AT EVERYTHING.  LOL Aside from losing my soul to Hades in the underworld,  this place is a must try if you've never gone.   It is super fun and extremely interactive. I will say that Hades voice in the initial preview movie they show you is a little too...""nice"" for me.  I almost wanted to laugh cause I always imagined him with a meaner raspy voice. But hey,  a God of the underworld should sound powerful so I guess they got that right.

"Rich L.Anaheim, CA72171421/20/2019This review is long over due. In Vegas for work, so my wife and I had to do an escape room (or two). This one was walking distance from our hotel room at the Rio. They room had only been open for about a week or 2, so there were some bugs. Hopefully they have fixed it by now.We did their Underworld and Mayan room with just the 2 of us.Underworld is a Greek/Roman myth theme I believe, and it wasn't too hard. We only had to use 1 clue. It was pretty good. Not much tech, but fair puzzles.The Mayan room looked much cooler, and much harder. They warned me that it would be harder, but I had never done a Mayan room before and I wanted to try it out. I would recommend 4 people for this room. To date, that was the only Mayan room I have ever done, so I guess you could say it was my favorite. One of the puzzle props were not set properly, and it was just laying on the floor. It was a pretty good puzzle too. But we definitely had so much trouble with it for just the 2 of us.I would come back again to try their other rooms in the future.Useful 1Funny 1Cool 1Business owner informationMelissa O.Business Manager2/25/2019Thank you so much, Rich!

"Katrina N.San Diego, CA204281/21/2019I would give this more of a 2.5 stars than 3 stars. First off, the game master gave our group a lot of attitude and was not very welcoming. He seemed very annoyed as he was giving explanations or hints. For the room itself, we did ""Underworld"", which is an easy room with props that seemed very cheap. All the puzzles led to a number or letter combination that opened a lock that gave a key. Finally, the end of the room was very anti climatic because it was just unlocking an object with all the keys we gathered. One of the boxes was not securely locked, and I was able to just reach in and grab the key. Also, some of the hints are useless or worn out. We escaped in 29 minutes.... waste of money. Overall, there are other rooms at Lockdown, but I don't think I will be coming back.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationMelissa O.Business Manager2/25/2019We are very sorry to hear that you did not have a 5 star experience, as that is always our goal.

"Callie G.Las Vegas, NV01451/5/2019I did the Mayan room with my brother at the Flamingo location. The quality of most of the room was nice which is why I gave 3 stars, and the guy working was also nice, however there were multiple issues that were extremely unfortunate. To begin, on the website the Mayan room is labeled a difficulty of ""Medium"" which is why I chose it for my brother and I since there would only be 2 of us. When we got there, he tells us that it's actually ""Hard"" and recommended at least 4 people and that it has a success rate of 18%. Okay, not a huge deal. We like a challenge and have both successfully competed every escape room we've ever done so we decide to still try. Our time ran out right before the final puzzle (I know this because the guy working came in and told us that we only had one left and explained what we did ""wrong"" on the one we were ""stuck"" on. We spent a significant amount of time trying to complete a puzzle that had to do with 5 balancing balls... after struggling for at least 10 minutes we ask for one of our 3 clues. He then tells us ""oh yeah two of the balls are broken that's why we wrote the numbers."" The thing is though just because they wrote the numbers doesn't fix the problem, if the balls don't work how they're supposed to then there's no way of knowing why they came up with those numbers if you don't know that the balls are broken. If we had known this BEFORE we even entered or if he had told us when he saw we were at that puzzle we would have made it out 100%. It was because of their broken equipment and not telling us it was broken until we asked that caused us not to make it out. Very disappointing especially finding out from him right after that we were at the last puzzle. Fix the equipment or tell people before they go in if something is broken and clearly not part of the room. Also, change the description on your website please. If we had know the difficulty we would have done our second choice at a different location.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationMelissa O.Business Manager2/25/2019Thank you very much for your feedback.

"Jared N.Elite '2021Henderson, NV3097105928/18/2018My dad wanted to get me something different for my birthday this year and an escape room was suggested by my aunt. I had never given much thought to escape rooms but it sounded interesting enough so the research began. And let me tell you, there is plenty to research. There are so many escape rooms in Las Vegas. I looked at several and the room I was most interested in was the Western room at Lockdown Flamingo. So my dad booked it for three of us. He and a friend of mine accompanied me.Neither of us had done an escape room before so we didn't know what to expect. We started with a briefing of the rules and watched an informational video giving us the back story of the room. We were then taken into the room and our 1 hour clock was started. The three of us were split into two jail cells which we had to break out of. I'm not going to say we cheated but we did not fully complete the first couple of puzzles. It was taking too damn long to get to the meat of the challenge. Once we were out of the cells we were on to the good puzzles that had more clues with which to work. We were on the right track with most everything and maybe even figured out a couple of clues but we were starting to run out of time. 45 minutes were gone and and we were given our 15 minute warning. But we weren't anywhere close to unlocking the final locks. Then we remembered we were allowed three clues. We used them. I'm not even going to lie. After the first two we were on top of our game. We knew exactly what to do for the last clue. Or maybe not. We used that third clue and with that the final lock was opened. We found the giant key and recovered the stolen totems thereby ending the cursed drought. All with four minutes to spare. Phew.This experience started out frustrating as all hell. But once we started finding our groove it became a lot of fun. What I am most fascinated by is the attention to detail. The thought that must go into creating the puzzles is staggering. Plus the atmosphere was spot on. It was dark as if in an 1880s jail lit by lantern. The headdress and arrows. Wanted posters and furniture. Everything matched the theme of the room. I appreciate the care that went in to this. Without giving anything away, if you come here or any escape room I imagine, be sure to bring your attention to detail. As they say, the devil is in the details. Things that seem inconsequential may have the biggest impact in either solving or not solving the puzzle and thus escaping the room.Useful 2Funny 1Cool 2Business owner informationMelissa O.Business Manager8/29/2018Thank you so much for your detailed review, Jared!

We have solved our share of hard puzzles, but for some reason we didn't get the Mayan room. There was a piece in the room we tried several times and nothing happened. It made us look at other things...we finally asked for a clue and sure enough we needed to use that piece. We tried to get it to work for awhile and then he finally came in..he had a hard time but he got it to give us the next clue...I think that spoiled it for us, pulled us out of the game play...and was uber disappointing. There were a few other snafus in the other room as well..it just led you to failure If you went a different direction...we like difficult rooms which is why we selected this one...but it just wasn't that fun.

"Loren A.Las Vegas, NV041/3/2021We were paired with Tiffany after interviewing Randy Hatada. As a military family with a short time frame for purchasing a home, she made herself fully available for the whole week that we were in town to make sure we saw as many houses as was necessary to find the right one. Tiffany was kind, courteous, and educational throughout the process which was very important to us as first time buyers. Most importantly, Tiffany followed our lead for how many houses we wanted to see per day, which houses we wanted to see, and let us decide when we were ready to place offers. She wasn't pushy and always made sure we had enough time to discuss what was best for us. We would work with Tiffany again in the future and will be recommending her to other military families.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationRandy H.Business Owner1/3/2021Aww Thank you for the kind review Loren.

"Brian F.Elite '2021San Francisco, CA26270343/23/2018Five stars all the way for this property! I stay here at least a couple of times a year, and for one of Marriott's limited service brands, the staff here really go out of their way. For example, when I changed reservations in the middle of our stay, they got me a better room and actually moved our luggage to the new room while we were out for the day. They also address me by name when I come and go. In particular, the woman at the front desk on weekday mornings is delightful, as are the two guys who work overnight.  I had even provided some constructive feedback the last time I stayed, and one of them remembered me and still treated me very kindly.  Even at the breakfast, the woman comes over, clears my plate, and asks if she can get me anything else. I have never had anybody speak to me at a limited service hotel morning breakfast buffet before!I also observe whenever I am in the lobby. This level of service is not just provided to me because I am gold elite.  Everyone is greeted with a smile, a kind word and a willingness to help.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationHotel M.Business Manager3/24/2018Dear Brian F.Thank you for taking the time to review SpringHill Suites Scottsdale North.

"Betsy W.Huntington Beach, CA023189/12/2020Stayed here during COVID and this was the first hotel I've stayed at where I was sketched out by the lack of cleanliness. Most hotels have been taking this really seriously. The first room they gave us, had a dead bug on the floor right when we walked in so I checked out the room closely like maybe the bug came in after cleaning? I don't think the bathroom had been cleaned other than fresh towels. The floors also didn't seem like they had been cleaned based on small things throughout the room. So the first desk changed our room ... okay second room - glitter! Glitter all over the floors and the bathroom. But it was 1 am so we chose glitter over dead bugs. There was food left in the fridge from the last person and a while milky film all over the floor. Seemed like the floor received soap but not cleaned up after maybe? Glad we had our own disinfect spray and pillows.   Also, be aware of an $8 parking fee, which no biggie BUT there's no security for that $8. I thought it would be enhanced like gates since we were paying for the parking lot in front of the hotel... nope just standard parking lot no gate. Overall, I'd stay somewhere else during COVID just the be safe.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationHotel M.Business Manager9/12/2020Dear Betsy,Thank you for reviewing your stay with us.

"Thom M.Stillwater, MN05212/29/2020I would avoid this place due to the following:1.    They charge to park in a open and none secured parking lot.   The answer from desk staff ""all the hotels for together in the area and decided to do it.""     Zero security to support the payment of parking.  2.  Management staff seems overwhelmed and cannot seem to maintain basic standards.  Dirty floors and room3.   By 8am they ran out of breakfast.   Coffee Empty and no plan to accommodate.  And lines or people coming down waiting for answers that never came (nor the breakfast).    At one point the desk clerk went into a janitor closet and threw out some cereal (no milk to go with it).  Just kept thinking that I paid for this service...4.   Smoking at the main entrance (outside within 15 feet)  to greet people as they arrive and depart.   Disgusting and should be moved 100 feet away.    Overall this place has the feel (and look) of an east coast dive that is run by poor management practices and lack or coordination.  Hitting a motel 6 is probably a better choice.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationHotel M.Business Manager12/29/2020Dear Thom,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel.

"Blair H.Loves Park, IL2342112/6/20182 photosStayed here for 9 nights. When I checked in, I needed to shower quick before heading off to work. As I was showering, I stepped on something. It was a cockroach. I almost fell down. Immediately disgusted, I called down to the front desk and told them what happened. They agreed to switch rooms. Fair enough. When I went down, I told the gal I wanted to be compensated with points for this inconvenience and quite frankly I was ready to leave. She assured me I would be. As a Platinum Elite, I think I have enough options to move, but I thought I Midas well just stay. Then I was moved to another room. Air conditioner not plugged in. Ok, I can live with it. Had to call maintenance again. Stayed for the 9 days. Fair hotel. Cleanliness obviously an issue. As I left, I ran into the General Manager.  I asked her if she knew what happened on my first day and she said it was noted in the computer and that I would be getting points for this. Now, I asked for 100k points when it initially happened, and that didn't seem to be an issue. After spending nearly 2k for the 9 days, I thought that was more than fair for stepping on a cockroach the size of my big toe while showering and deciding not to check out right there and then. Come one month later this hotel refuses to compensate me. What they did do however was insult me with a whopping 250 bonus points. Completely unacceptable.  Can't recommend staying here for a number of reasons, but mostly they seem to not care about their customers. I definitely won't be back after not getting what I was assured I would get.  Bugs happen but when they do you take care of the customers, not treat them like it was noBig deal.  Enjoy the photos.Useful 3FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationHotel M.Business Manager12/7/2018Dear Blair, Thank you for choosing our hotel for your stay.  We would like to offer our apologies for not living up to your expectations.

Cleanliness is a number one MUST and this place fits the bill. I am not sure how old the hotel is, but it feels fresh/new enough.I did not hear or see anyone else on my floor, however the parking lot was full, and breakfast had plenty of people. Translation... it's comfortable and quiet, even when it's busy.I didn't have time to try the free breakfast, but it looked like there was plenty of room and tables (I've seen other places lack this before). There are plenty of dining options nearby, but only a couple that are within a quick walk.

The staff was very friendly, particularly those working at the check-in desk, the shuttle driver and the lady working in the breakfast area. They are currently upgrading all of the guest rooms and I was told that I was in one of the newer rooms. The hotel is quiet. There's no restaurant in the hotel. However, they have snacks and drinks available for purchase downstairs, there is a nearby restaurant that delivers (menu was in the room) and breakfast is complimentary. Breakfast had a great spread including croissants, bagels, toast, muffins, fresh fruit, yogurt, boiled eggs, oatmeal with several mix in, cereal, eggs, sausage, potatoes, juice, tea & coffee. There is always ice water available in the lobby if you have a cup or reusable water bottle to refill (great for those triple digit days!). There is a free hotel shuttle that will take you within a 5 mile radius of the hotel, which is super helpful since there are a ton of shops and restaurants nearby.

As I sat there I watched not 1, but 5 different mice run along the walls, across the dining area, and up the pillars.And they somehow figured out how to create the worst tasting cappuccino ever created. The milk was scalded to the point of curdling. There were chunks in the foam. And the espresso was pulled from an over hot machine creating a bitter, ash flavor.And this single shot cappuccino cost $4.39!I didn't complain or return the coffee, because I was there to meet a person for a business meeting. I just put aside the coffee and buried my disgust.I can't believe this place exists. Do yourself a favor. Don't get suckered in by the intriguing, artistic space.

"Emily H.Kingman, AZ4546234/3/20213 photosThis salon was a nightmare, I went to them twice for a full set and a fill because they are close to my neighborhood. I had Kelly the first time and it was a good experience the second time I got an older woman and she was super aggressive during the visit and kept yanking my hand so I didn't go back again. Yesterday I went to get a fill at a different place and they found fungus growing underneath the acrylic nails. I called today and spoke to the man at the front desks and he denied that it was the salons fault for the fungus and would not issue a refund for the unprofessional service. I've been getting my nails done with acrylics for 10+ years and have never had this happen. I'm honestly disgusted at what happened and the response I was given.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationJenifer N.Business Manager4/28/2021Hi Emily.  We’re sorry that u had a negative experience at our salon.  Regarding the fungus on your middle finger, it is rather difficult to determine the cause.  Typically this happens when there’s lifting on acrylics.  And lifting can happen when a patron does not get refill on time.  It is recommended that refill should be done every 2-3 weeks.  Base on your purchase history, you’ve gone beyond 4 weeks in between refills.  The last technician who serviced you has more than 20 years of experience and she never had any fungus issue.  We would be glad to take care of your next refill with compensation, regardless of the cause of fungus.  However, refund is not an option because our services are NOT refundable.  We wish you the best and remind you not to go beyond 2-3 weeks between refills.Read more","Business owner informationJenifer N.Business Manager4/28/2021Hi Emily.  We’re sorry that u had a negative experience at our salon.  Regarding the fungus on your middle finger, it is rather difficult to determine the cause.  Typically this happens when there’s lifting on acrylics.  And lifting can happen when a patron does not get refill on time.  It is recommended that refill should be done every 2-3 weeks.  Base on your purchase history, you’ve gone beyond 4 weeks in between refills.  The last technician who serviced you has more than 20 years of experience and she never had any fungus issue.  We would be glad to take care of your next refill with compensation, regardless of the cause of fungus.  However, refund is not an option because our services are NOT refundable.  We wish you the best and remind you not to go beyond 2-3 weeks between refills.Read more"
"Chris K.Minot, ND5027143/21/2021I have had two gel pedicures here now and plan to go back for a third very soon. The salon is clean and always promptly had me seated and soaking my feet at my appointment time. They have a lot of chairs so social distancing hasn't been a problem when I have been there. I usually try for a mid morning appointment. My first pedicure was perfect, the second wasn't quite as great, but still very well done. I can't believe how long a gel pedicure will last!UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationJenifer N.Business Manager5/2/2021Thank you and we look forward to seeing you againRead more",Business owner informationJenifer N.Business Manager5/2/2021Thank you and we look forward to seeing you againRead more
"Kelly M.New York, NY40062122/4/2017AVOID THIS CAR SERVICE: ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A WOMAN. I called the main # because I couldn't find my car, while waiting in the lobby of my hotel. No driver called me back to find me or confirm, so I called the main number back 15 min later, worried I might miss my flight. When I finally found my driver and went to throw my suitcase in his trunk, he yelled at me and proceeded to argue about not being able to find me. I tried to explain that I'd been trying to reach him by calling the main #, but he continued to blame me for the situation, and the situation escalated quickly. It's surreal to type/share this, but he started yelling at me, called me ""a F*#ing B@$th"" and threatened to ""punch me in the face"" if I didn't get out of his car. It quickly became a verbally abusive situation. After getting away, I called the manager/owner (?) immediately to relay the exchange and he was defensive and asked me what I expected him to do about. How about apologize profusely for a driver that verbally abused a woman and threatened to hit her? What a horrible, irresponsible company.UPDATE-RESPONDING TO THE OWNER'S RESPONSE: I called your company twice while waiting for my pick-up, because I'd gone downstairs to the lobby of my building at 8:45am, when the pick-up was scheduled. I called your company at 8:49am (from my phone log) to try to reach my driver, but I received no call back. I waited and then called back at 8:58am. At this point, I was worried I might miss my flight and I was upset. I've used professional car services for a long time and I've never encountered a company that doesn't give the drivers the passenger's contact number and/or have them call if there's a Miscommunication or they're unable to connect.What is most troubling about your response is thatyou're taking no accountability for your driver's actions or your company's inappropriate response.Your driver, after calling me a horrible name, THREATENED TO PUNCH ME IN THE FACE. He never de-escalated the situation and once he said that, I feared for my physical safety. SO, IN EFFECT, IN YOUR RESPONSE YOU'RE CONTINUING TO BLAME NOT ONLY YOUR CUSTOMER, BUT A WOMAN WHO'D BEEN THREATENED BY PHYSICAL VIOLENCE by your driver.And regarding that first pick up in PITT three days earlier? Your driver showed up late and I had to call you twice to find him. (Flight changes happen. I was delayed out of LAX due to fog. I called you as soon as I knew about every change.) Review stands. Very unprofessional. I'll let Yelp reviewers decide.Final update: The fact that you're continuing to argue with a female customer after YOUR DRIVER THREATENED TO HIT HER just illustrates what a tone-deaf manager and deeply misogynistic person you are. You should be ashamed of yourself.You've been defensive and horrible throughout this entire exchange, as evidenced by your need to continue blaming me. You only apologized the day of the incidence on the phone after I started crying. I was thinking of deleting this whole exchange because I want to put it behind me, but women in Pittsburgh need to know your drivers are potentially dangerous.Useful 1Funny 1Cool 1Business owner informationDavid S.Business Owner2/5/2017Hello.  I am the owner of First Class Limousine Service, established in 1985.  First let me say that I am VERY sorry that you were disappointed in the service you received from my driver.  Being in business for almost 32 years, surely, our services are very dependable, or I wouldn't be in business this long, particularly in that we service the largest universities, hospitals, museums, businesses, etc.  It's a difficult business to be perfect at, but we try very hard.That said, I'd like to address the specific issues of Kelly M:The property where where we were scheduled to pick Kelly up for an airport transfer is an old style apartment building that operates as a hotel, therefore there is no front desk, of sorts.  There is no way to enter the building.and the office is a block down the street in another one of their 5 or 6 buildings,  At these properties, the drivers are instructed to sit in the vehicle until the passenger comes out.  The driver was on site 13 minutes before the scheduled pick-up time, which I verified with our vehicle GPS tracking.  At the scheduled pick-up time, the driver (who has been with me over 10 years) called the main office of the property.  The office clerk phoned the room twice, but, nobody answered.  So, the driver waited.When Kelly M. finally reached me about 15 minutes later, she was EXTREMELY hot under the collar!  I apologized to her, and told her that the car was simply sitting in the driveway.  By the time she walked outside to to the driver, she was VERY upset, which set off an unfortunate, and likely avoidable, verbal exchange with the driver.  Supposedly, she violently threw her bag(s) in the trunk.  The driver (claims) he tried to de-escalate the situation, suggesting to her that she ""forget all of that, and let's go""!  I'm sure it could have been handled better, and I DO apologize for that!  Believe me!I believe the entire incident could have been avoided if my driver had simply walked up to the front door to the building, or if Kelly had simply walked outside the building to see that the car was sitting in the driveway.Kelly, as I said to you on the phone, I'm VERY sorry that you had this problem with my employee, as this is certainly not the norm.  That said, you were upset that the driver didn't call your cell phone to tell you he was there.  In practice, we normally don't do this until 15 minutes has passed from the pickup time, as people are usually finishing packing, or eating.Once again, if you read my other reviews, you will find NOTHING even close to a story like this.  One thing my company is known for, above all else, is having extremely friendly drivers.  To say that women shouldn't use my service, I believe, is a little over the top, as, some of the most prominent women in Pittsburgh are long-time customers of mine.Thanks for taking the time to read my reply.DSEdited to add:  I wish Kelly would add how she praised us over the phone, because of how readily we accommodated her when she arrived at PIT airport 3 days earlier, when her flight routing was changed twice with minimal notice, from 7:42 PM to 9:39 PM, then to 11:20 PM.In response to your comment about the driver being late:  Your flight arrived 20 minutes early.  I remember CLEARLY when I spoke to you on the phone from the airport.  You were very understanding, and quite happy to wait a few minutes while I called the driver, and I got the two of you together in less than 5 minutes.Further reply:  I apologized to you 3 times in my reply above, for anything my driver may have said to you that upset you, and multiple times on the phone.  I'm really not sure what else you would like me to do for you at this point.  I have spoken with the driver, but I can't vouch for anything specific that was said to you during your interaction, as I wasn't there.That said, the personal attacks you made about me, are unsubstantiated, COMPLETELY without merit, and simply, don't dignify a response from me.Read more","Business owner informationDavid S.Business Owner2/5/2017Hello.  I am the owner of First Class Limousine Service, established in 1985.  First let me say that I am VERY sorry that you were disappointed in the service you received from my driver.  Being in business for almost 32 years, surely, our services are very dependable, or I wouldn't be in business this long, particularly in that we service the largest universities, hospitals, museums, businesses, etc.  It's a difficult business to be perfect at, but we try very hard.That said, I'd like to address the specific issues of Kelly M:The property where where we were scheduled to pick Kelly up for an airport transfer is an old style apartment building that operates as a hotel, therefore there is no front desk, of sorts.  There is no way to enter the building.and the office is a block down the street in another one of their 5 or 6 buildings,  At these properties, the drivers are instructed to sit in the vehicle until the passenger comes out.  The driver was on site 13 minutes before the scheduled pick-up time, which I verified with our vehicle GPS tracking.  At the scheduled pick-up time, the driver (who has been with me over 10 years) called the main office of the property.  The office clerk phoned the room twice, but, nobody answered.  So, the driver waited.When Kelly M. finally reached me about 15 minutes later, she was EXTREMELY hot under the collar!

"TC R.Pittsburgh, PA046/23/2014Other people may have had a better experience with this company but that was not the case for us.  We had rented a limo/bus for a bachelor party.  Our driver Scott, was completely clueless in navigating the city. Constantly making wrong turns and missing exits. All of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go. Each destination took 3-4 times longer to reach due to his incompetence. This caused us to have to skip a couple of our originally planned stops. After returning to the bus after one of our stops we were informed by Scott that the police had come onto the bus and searched it with dogs. Really?!??!  Why??!!  How??!!  We found that our bags had been rifled through and we all felt a little violated and confused. By this point we decided to call it a night. More than half of our passengers didn't care to step back onto the bus and took cabs home. Just when we thought the worst was over we were wrong. As we enter the highway we realize that Scott has driven all the way up the ramp and onto the highway going THE WRONG WAY!!!  He starts slowly reversing down the ramp while oncoming cars honk and swerve all around us!  Truly terrifying. After that, we were very upset and just wanted to get home. So after several more wrong turns we finally get home. Absolutely terrible night. So if you'd like to book a party bus that will include a geographically blind driver, unecessary police involvement, a near death experience and just an overall sense of frustration mixed with panic then go with these guys. Otherwise, I would suggest staying far, far away!Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationDavid S.Business Owner2/4/2017This is simply a case of mistaken identity. . . .Hello, I am the owner of First Class Limousine Service, established 1985.During almost 32 years in business, I have NEVER had a limo bus - of ANY type!  Nearly 100% of our business is airport transfers in regular everyday type sedans.There is another First Class Limousine Service from somewhere in West Virginia or Ohio that services Pittsburgh with limo buses, that has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with my company.  I frequently get their erroneous phone calls.DSRead more","Business owner informationDavid S.Business Owner2/4/2017This is simply a case of mistaken identity. . . .Hello, I am the owner of First Class Limousine Service, established 1985.During almost 32 years in business, I have NEVER had a limo bus - of ANY type!  Nearly 100% of our business is airport transfers in regular everyday type sedans.There is another First Class Limousine Service from somewhere in West Virginia or Ohio that services Pittsburgh with limo buses, that has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with my company.  I frequently get their erroneous phone calls.DSRead more"
"Stacey L.Elite '2021Madison, WI20791186326312/2/20191 photoThe subs at Firehouse aren't mindblowing, but they definitely feel a step up from Subway's, Milio's, etc. I'd been to the Fish Hatchery location a few times last year, but this was my first visit to the westside store. We stopped on a Sunday night and it was pretty quiet. It took a bit for the clerk to notice us standing there, but he was overly apologetic once he did. I gave one of their turkey sandwiches a try, with everything on it except for the onions. The smoked turkey didn't have a discernible smoked flavor, but the quality was on par with Quizno's. The bread was good and nothing got too soggy despite their steaming schtick. I appreciate the pickle spear on the side and the price for a medium isn't too crazy. The restaurant space itself commits fully to the firefighting theme, including Dalmatian-print tables and a mural with Bucky Badger hanging out in front of a burning building - you know, like you do. This location was less steamy/smoky than the other location I've been to, and everything was clean and orderly. For a quick sandwich, it's not a bad spot, especially now that Sliced is no longer in business.MuralUseful 4FunnyCool 3Business owner informationGuest Services at Firehouse SubsBusiness Manager12/3/2019Stacey, thank you for the feedback!

"Anthony S.Madison, WI52614/30/2018Sandwich was expensive without any real leg up over the competition. Products slopped out of the sandwich when I tried to pick it up on both sides. Staff seemed somewhat listless and uncommunicative past their minimum requirement, which tells me they're probably underpayed, overworked, under-appreciated.Women were operating the registers while minorities made the food. Checked the website; upper management is all white men. I see a pattern here.I have gone to two Firehouse sub locations, both in Madison, and each time I find myself asking ""Why did I go here? Oh yeah, I'm pressed for time and this place is on the way,"" and then I endeavor to not go back. Edit: I checked what firehouse pays hourly @ the register and food prep - I now understand where the minimum effort comes from; it reflects the unsustainable wage they pay their workforce whilst donating thousands to firefighter and law enforcement-related charities.UsefulFunny 1CoolBusiness owner informationGuest S.Business Owner5/7/2018Anthony, thank you for taking the time to share your concerns with us.

Nope I will not be back! When I received my pedicure I had to ask for her to cut my cuticles. After my subpar pedicure...they didn't remove the plastic covering the chair they just wiped it down with the same towel used for my pedicure. The plastic covering the bowl was not removed either. Nothing was wiped down or sanitized. To top it off,While getting a NEW full set I asked to have my cuticles removed she said it would be five dollars extra.  (Guess Nini has a thing against cutting cuticles) before we even began my full set I showed her the picture of what I wanted she said ok. Then I clearly specified that I wanted the ballerina shape on my nails. I had to correct her over and over  on the length and my shape that I just gave up! When it came time to polish she asked to see the photo again and  I showed her then she states oh you want Gel glitter and Gel color that will be Five dollars more since it is a design. I said no ma'am it's just a different color I don't want any designs. She said well you want more than one color it is like a design. I chose to just get one color since I had already paid $5 to cut my cuticles! So in total I ended up paying $97.00 for a BASIC pedicure and Basic Set!

"Sofia A.Ellicott City, MD173537/23/20191 photoService was quick but the nails lasted just as long. I was so excited to get acrylics for my birthday however they didn't last long. The lady that did my nails did not fill in all the way so 2-3 days into them being done it looked like I was due for a fill in....you know it's bad when a MAN tells u that u need to get a fill in.

"Ed R.Brooklyn, NY314214/3/2018The list of reasons to not go here: The up-sell is insane, they wanted to replace all my existing fillings, tried to sell me invisilign, and said they don't accept my insurance so I paid for my exam and cleaning out of pocket, something like $800 but it was for 2 visit cleanings. What they don't tell you is it's a ""gentle cleaning"" and they then up-sell on a deep cleaning. I've never heard that one before. They also have a $100 cancellation fee. There was no one in the place when I went, what dentist have you gone to and the entire lobby is empty? I wish I read the reviews on this place first, i see so many people had the same bad experience and now i have to find a new dentist.

"Bre R.Williamsburg, NY012/28/2018I was skeptical going here because it seemed all reviews were either 1 star or 5 stars-- no in-between? I scheduled a regular cleaning that the office reassured me would be covered 100% by my insurance company. Like a lot of the 1 star reviews on here I was told I had multiple cavities (I've never even had 1 before) and was charged $800 for 30 minutes of service and my insurance covered $754. I stilled owed $46, which is only a small portion, but how is a standard cleaning ever $800? Complete and total scam. DO NOT go here under any circumstances. Like many other reviewers, I feel the need to report this practice as what they are doing is beyond wrong.Useful 4Funny 1CoolBusiness owner informationian m.Business Owner3/27/2018Hi Bre, I am truly sorry that you feel this way.

"Anastasia K.Lake View, Chicago, IL0318/6/2019This dentist takes advantage of people who are actually fearful of going to the dentist! About two years ago, they told me I had four pockets of cavities to be filled and they recommended that it be done within two years. In that time, I moved to another state to go to college and didn't have the money to pay for any of their services (which are honestly through the roof). Fast forward to going to Hilldale Dental where I had an excellent visit, I was told differently. Two years later, I have ZERO cavities. I want to emphasize that this has not just happened with me, but also to my sister and her boyfriend. They both got recommended to do extensive work to their teeth for a ridiculous price when it wasn't necessary. They both felt weird and like their recommendations didn't make sense, so they got a second opinion and it was confirmed that they needed minimal work done. No Fear Dentistry is really only out for money. Save your money and save your worries for real problems. I highly recommend Hilldale Dental with Fred Jaeger. He is super personable and accurate in his recommendations and won't make you do any unnecessary crap to your teeth. He and his nurses took great care of my teeth, were funny, and made sure to inform me on everything they were doing during  appointment. SHAME ON YOU for taking advantage of people who are truly fearful of going to the dentist. You are preying on people who seek your office out as support to have healthier teeth. For many people going here, people haven't been to a dentist for years out of fear, and they take advantage of that by saying you need to have crazy work done on your teeth. Don't support them if you have the choice through your insurance.Useful 6FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationCameron L.Business Manager7/22/2020Good afternoon Anastasia,  For starters I would like to personally apologize for never reaching out to you before this time.

"Katherine O.Las Vegas, NV66217767610/11/2018This year, Patrick the optician helped me and my mom out and he was nothing short of amazing! Came to pick up my glasses and knew how to adjust the glasses just by looking at me.  He was so good at what he does, that I barely needed any adjustments after the first go around. I also had a question about why the thickness of my lenses was thicker than what I was used to (even though I pay extra for the thinner versions.) He explained how because of the frames I picked, it looks thicker than when I get my usual thick Ray-Ban lens. He even offered to polish the sides to make them appear thinner. I came back in an hour and they were perfect!Would recommend always going to Patrick for adjustments or any of my glasses needs.Useful 7Funny 3Cool 6Business owner informationMatthew W.Business Owner11/1/2018Hi Katherine!

"CalGal V.Henderson, NV12344/3/2020On a Sunday afternoon I noticed that I had a nail in my tire.  I stopped in Tire Works to see if they could put a plug in it, and was greeted by Kumanu, the Assistant Manager.  He took a look at it and told me what I kind of already knew... the tires were old... and he said that putting a plug in might crack the tire.  I didn't have time to get all new tires put on because I had to pick up someone at the airport in about an hour.  Instead they put my spare tire on to get me safely to and from the airport and back home.  When I went inside to pay Kumanu told me ""no charge"" even though I insisted because I felt bad for not paying them SOMETHING.  I have so much gratitude for Kumanu in helping me late on a Sunday and easing my stress.  The best customer service ever!Useful 5FunnyCool 1Business owner informationJeffry G.Business Manager4/6/2020CalGal V, we are always happy to help!

"GD T.Park La Brea, CA5348/31/2020Excellent, friendly service. Today I was helped by Dez, who normally works call center customer service. Very friendly. I already knew what was wrong, I had a big screw sticking out of my tire and it needed to be patched. I made an online appointment and while I was there someone phoned me to set up the appointment. The tech was already fixing my tire though, as I got lucky and it was not too busy and someone could help me right away. Fix took about 35 minutes. When I went to pay, Dez told me it was free and I should just give the tech a gratuity if I wanted to. I did. Free tire repair is obviously a marketing tool to get new customers and in this case it worked. I will be back when I need service. I do not mine paying businesses that do things like this as a premium for customers.UsefulFunnyCool 2Business owner informationJeffry G.Business Manager9/3/2020Thank you, GD T, for your wonderful review!

Very friendly service and that's the one of the many things it makes them stand out from the rest. I really hope things go well with the braking system and hope I don't have to spend another dime.

"April B.Glendale, AZ211112/26/2018I was very disappointed with the poor class on this past Sunday. The instructor was not informed it was the first time she had ever did this type of class, her supplies were low because she had no idea how much she would use. I also realized late in the day that her quality of paint and supplies was a very low dollar option. It was obvious to me that the finished product was that of someone who was using substandard paints, flow, and silicone. Other people brought their own supplies and their pictures turned out better because their supplies were better quality. I will not return whether it's for a pour class or painting class this was not a fun experience at all I feel as though my money was completely wasted thank you and goodbye.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationAmy M.Business Owner10/10/2018April, I know we had emailed each other back in February.

"Uneka H.Elite '2021Charlotte, NC13143028049/19/20208 photosROTD 12/13/2020So I just joined yesterday and I have to say this gym is NICE!!! So as you all know the gyms all across the US has been closed due to Covid-19. I just moved to this state about a week ago however in Jersey (Jersey girl!) the gyms opened up about 2 weeks ago. Needless to say, I needed to get back in the gym (as safely as possible) ASAP!First let's start off with, this gym is HUGE! When I first walked in I was automatically greeted by the gentleman at the front desk. Alex (who was AMAZING btw) showed me around and was very patient with me while I asked a ton of questions. Afterwards, I had to ask the million dollar question ""How Much Is it per month!!??""  The answer I was given blew me away- $10 A MONTH! I could not believe it! I even told them I wasn't looking for a contract because I didn't want to be locked in and guess what?????? He still said it was $10 A MONTH for all of this! (See pics). Today was the first day that I worked out and was very satisfied. The machines/facilities were clean, staff was helpful and made sure people wore their masks. They even had a ""woman's section"" where women could work out comfortably and with other women If they should choose.

"Anisha H.Elite '2021Charlotte, NC32529926488/1/2018Had my first experience at Fitness Connection. My friend works out here and suggested I try the 5 day Fitness pass. Pulling out to the facility at 7:00pm, the gym was super packed. I presume this would be the case because the time was so late. But the number of people in the faculty was overwhelming. I had trouble accessing my free pass online, so in route to the location I contacted I was able to locate a treadmill on the first row which was nice. I did my 20 minutes until my friend arrived. Once she arrived I joined her in what I call the chaos jungle. It was an absolute madhouse in the weight/machine area. So many people using machines, not cleaning them properly and worst of all leaving weights ALL OVER THE GYM! No common courtesy for the next person that possibly wants to use them. And staff wasn't anywhere around to address the matter. What normally take an hour for me to workout took and hour and thirty minutes It was the worst. I used my 5 day pass that day only.

"Karen L.Glendale, AZ2916148/22/2019Dr. Amanda Modesta is the best doctor I've ever had. What I personally appreciate most is that it's easy to get a same or next day appointment. I never have to wait more than 15-20 minutes. Dr. Modesta keeps up with all my health needs including contacting me when it's time for various checkups, vaccinations, blood draws, etc. Her office staff is always friendly and welcoming but not always efficient. This is a teaching office, which I appreciate. However, as interns come and go, I believe some are a bit overwhelmed. All in all, my experience with Shafa Medical Clinic and Dr. Amanda Modesta has been exceptional over the past 20 years.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationAlexis G.Business Employee11/11/2019Thank you for your comment.

"Kaitlin P.Mesa, AZ175585/30/2019I have never seen a more disorganized medical office. Inaccurate Billing statements, lack of structure, and unethical policies. The office staff are all very uneducated in billing, insurance, and standard practice. I had a billing discrepancy that two hours and 5 staff members to solve. Apparently a previous contractor who managed their billing didn't run my primary insurance for an office visit 16 months ago. The contractor told shafa medical that I had over $500 in outstanding payments, so shafa medical sent me the outrageous bill, and the shafa medical clinic office told me to contact THEIR previous contractor. Clients should never be responsible for those discrepancies. Why am I at fault for the contractor's mistakes? Also beware, ""standard office practice"" is charging $94 for an office visit, and not regarding a copay. The only focus is the deductible and if that has been met. I tried explaining a what a copay is to the office assistant and she replied that copays are not eligible until deductibles are met. She replied that she called our insurance, but she didn't talk to any representatives from our insurance company. We called our insurance company in front of her and he confirmed that she never spoke with a representative. He explained that we have a $25 copay with in network providers. She then had to be educated on the phone by the insurance re about how our insurance works, and how she should bill our company. Would not recommend.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationAlexis G.Business Employee11/11/2019Thank you for your feedback.

"Chelsea B.Chicago, IL1081867/26/2018Well, I saw the Dr. back in January 2016. Her practice worked with the  insurance I had at the time. It was a one-time, 5-minute visit for an RX refill, as I changed jobs and had to find a new doctor. I never heard a peep from this office again. Fast forward 2.5 years, and here we are. I just received a call this morning from a debt collector, telling me I owe $185 in bills. I've NEVER received a bill from this office (I would never not pay a doctor's bill), and despite talking to the office, the billing department and the debt collector, not a single person is able to provide a breakdown of the cost of my visit. My insurance covered an additional $145 of this bill - So what I'm really wondering is a) What happened in that 5 minute visit to warrant a total of $300+????? and b) WHY DID I NEVER RECEIVE A BILL? Turns out - they wrote my address down wrong. Now I owe a debt collector $185 for a 5 minute visit in a dingy office to get an rx refill of a medication I had been taking for over 5 years.Useful 2FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationAlexis G.Business Employee11/11/2019Thank you for your feedback.

"nakeshea l.Altadena, CA758/10/2018I had been a patient here for several years. I recently had an appointment scheduled when I received a phone call, probably two days before I was scheduled to go in. There was an employee from the doctor office saying I owe almost $500 in doctor visits bills dating all the way back to 2016. How does a patient who comes in routinely, suddenly have $500 worth of bill that are two years old!? The employee told me, if I can't pay about half of what I owe, I can't have my appointment with the doctor. I told her, cancel my appointment then. I asked the billing person to send me an itemized list of all of my visits and billing from 2016 to present. That was about a month ago. Haven't received the letter with any details. I've been getting called by a debt collector instead. I may need to contact my old insurance to check the claims.

No one even came out to say sorry or how long it would be. She is nice but after waiting in the lobby for so long and for her to come in the room and talk to u for 4 minutes is crazy.

"Leigh M.Tempe, AZ84132/6/2018Updated reviewI want to share an update that I thought was important. When I first came to this clinic it was for chronic fatigue and other symptoms. I have a history of thyroid problems and was concerned things had gotten worse. I got bloodwork done and it came back positive for thyroid antibodies and low low low iron, but even in light of this Dr. Modesta-Keyhani ignored the results and instead told me I had a gluten allergy. I am a researcher, and all the hard evidence points to gluten ""allergies"" not being a real thing - and the fact that she had test results in front of her telling her verbatim what was wrong with me and she STILL went for the gluten is ridiculous. 2 years later and I have been treated for iron anemia and Hashimotos by an endocrinologist and all of my symptoms are gone.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationAlexis G.Business Employee11/11/2019Thank you for your feedback. We care about our patients. We are very pleased that your finally feel better.Read more10/26/2015Previous reviewDr. Modesta-Keyhani is friendly and knowledgeable, appears to have a very solid medical background, and it is fairly easy to schedule quick appointments.  Unfortunately, those are the only positives in my 6 weeks working with this clinic.While the doctor is friendly and capable, I really got the impression that she is incredibly overbooked and this showed in the service I received.  Every appointment I had was extremely hurried, which made it really difficult to process information and ask questions.  I left appointments feeling confused and like my case wasn't given the attention it needed.  It seems like they are trying to churn out as many patients as possible, rather than giving proper time and attention to fewer patients.  One particular frustration is that any time I had test results, I had to come in for an in-person appointment instead of just receiving a phone call letting me know what results meant.  This resulted in 3 appointments that I felt were completely unnecessary and could've been handled by phone.  That may be office policy, but I've had doctors in the past who call with test results and that just saves everyone time and frustration.Even more than this, my main qualm is with the support staff and with repeated mistakes made by them.  While they are friendly, they seem to not know what's going on most of the time.  My first round of blood and urine samples were lost with no explanation, no one had any idea who had handled them or where they had gone (which is totally unsettling...where did my blood go??).  I had to come back in to correct this, a real inconvenience considering the 30 minute drive and 12 hours of fasting.  Recently, the doctor ordered an out-of-office procedure for me and I was told that I would be contacted by the specialist in one or two days to schedule, and after not hearing anything for a week I called Shafa to follow up only to find that the paperwork hadn't been sent to the specialist until 5 days later.  It was just a simple fax.  I can't count how many times I heard ""oh...I don't know what happened, I don't know how that works"", etc. in my really basic questions to them.My 6 weeks at this clinic were very frustrating, and I am going to look elsewhere for a PCP.Read more",Business owner informationAlexis G.Business Employee11/11/2019Thank you for your feedback.

"Susan S.Phoenix, AZ12717/23/2017Initially, I loved the really tiny  office and ridiculously long wait times cause the doc was so nice.  As time wore on, this became tedious.  The last straw was going to her office for ""clearance"" before an eye operation.It took me 6 months to get the eye operation and I needed all lab results to be in before a certain date or I would loose the OR spot.  I repeatedly called her office wondering why they had not sent in the results to the eye doc.  The latter also called her office up until the day before my scheduled OR appointment.  Needless to say, my OR appt. was cancelled and I have to wait another 6 months of seeing double before I can be scheduled again.Evidently Dr Modesta saw an elevated cholesterol and liver enzymes in my lab work, but I never heard a word from the office.  I could have explained both as a side effect from a drug I was taking, but I was not given the courtesy of an explanation.  Unprofessional is inadequate to describe this doctor/patient relationship.Doctor Modesta needs to retrain her professional staff or hire some qualified folks to run her office.  And get back to your patients in a timely fashion.  This practice is poorly run.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationAlexis G.Business Employee11/11/2019Thank you for your feedback.

"Drew C.San Antonio, TX82211/20/2020Bought a used Toyota Highlander here.  Spouse and I noticed body blemishes on the vehicle. I noticed one on the door. Our salesman Chris noted it for repair by the dealer.  I did a once over of the vehicle and found a scrape down the grill.  He said he'd catalog it too.  When we went inside we worked our financing over the phone with our lender.  When he produced the paperwork to take to the back to deal with the finance department, I noticed he didn't add the second issue I found.  We were headed to the back to complete the transaction and brought it to his attention.  He said to go ahead and head to the back and he'd update it for the service department.  They are the ones who really needed it. I didn't hesitate to trust him.  My mistake. I should have pressed him. I expected to get a call from the service department in the week. Once I did I we coordinated the repair.  By that time the 2nd issue repair just about left my radar, But I remembered and brought to their attention.  Despite everything, they wouldn't acknowledge the 2nd item.  Chris either completely forgot or didn't want to acknowledge.So, my takeaway for other customers is to make sure you do a complete inspection of a used car.  Take lots of pictures.  Ensure you don't leave the sales person's desk without them documenting any issues you found for them to repair later.  Toyota of Surprise is NOT worth spending your hard-earned money at.Go someplace where your sales person's attention is not just about cashing in the sale.

"Hollis H.Sula, MT011/18/2020I had a quote from another auto repair shop and almost had a heart attack.  I decided to call Jakes Auto Repair. I spoke to Greg and based on that conversation, i decided to have him check out my 2006 Nissan Titan to confirm all the repairs i was quoted from the other shop. After looking at everything, Greg called me and explained that the only thing that was needed was brake fluid flush.  That was a 2000.00 savings for me.  I'm a single grandmother and i'm planning camping trips this summer to get out of the heat and i need an honest and competent mechanic in otder to my grandchildren and i safe.  After that experience, i am happy and relieved to know i found a repair shop with integrity.  Oh the icing on the cake, i have had a tire pressure and air bag light on for over a year and the other shop ignored my request two times to check them and turn them off. I did not ask Greg to check them...but i sure was happy when i noticed they were gone...UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationGregory B.Business Owner1/28/2020Thanks Hollis!

They did an oil change the 1st time I went, then a coolant flush the 2nd time.  AND NEVER AGAIN!!  Please BEWARE taking your vehicle here!!! Dishonest people!  Women, take everything out of your car. AND  men also...   they stole  some classic CD's out of my car.  It was them, as I forgot to take them out the night before & the next day I went on a trip the next morning.  I went to   plug one in the player & find them GONE! They weren't stolen at my home as I have a RING doorbell & shows every movement. So what do you have to say for yourself guys??  A...N...D, My cabin filter was gone that I had installed myself.  I haven't felt good about one of the mechanics, Warren, but they're both in cahoots together.  Greg backs him up. He gave me a bad feeling.  I didn't trust him from the start! I did nothing to him but be nice.  Warren even asked me if I was married!! What the 'H_ _ _ does that have to do with my car??? Of course, he's going to say, ""I did not""!  That's none of his business! I had NEVER been asked that at a repair shop! Greg proceeds to tell me, it couldn't be Warren, as he has everything on bluetoothe, whatever and  I was with him the whole time..  No, he wasn't!  A few times, he comes in & works on the computer for quite awhile, while Waren is out in the garage  where my car is.  He could have given my CD's to his folks or friends, etc., etc.   I'm NOT stupid!!

"Melissa G.Elite '2021Chandler, AZ21911451/29/20214 photosWe absolutely love Joyride Taco House. The atmosphere is super hip and cool. They also have a super cute backyard style patio that is dog friendly. We love the happy hour that has $5 pitchers of beer or $5 margaritas along with $2 tacos!! They also offer many gluten free items and they are all marked on the menu for your convenience! The chips and salsa are really good but not very spicy however you can order the habanero salsa for the heat! All the tacos are really good and you can't really go wrong with any of them. My personal favorite currently is the pork taco and my husbands is the fried fish taco. We also like to order their veggie side. Sometimes this changes seasonally it seems but this particular time it was roasted mushrooms with poblano's and they were delicious! I also love the tropical margarita which is a mango and coconut base. We hit this place up at least a few times a month and It would be a great place to bring out of town guests as well since it is so hip and you get such a great service.

"Liz F.Elite '2021Gilbert, AZ3382411498/16/20203 photosYummm! Im a big fan! We ordered takeout tonight - a total of 7 tacos and two margaritas. They included complimentary chips and salsa.When picking up takeout, you'll have to find street parking, as they don't have a good pull up spot. To the right of the main entrance, on the side patio, you'll find you take out food bagged on a table with your name on it. We got the following tacos:CARNE ASADA - meh, meat didn't have the texture of a quality steak. Seasoning tasted like what I'd get out of a packet at the grocery store. THE STANDARD - slow roasted chicken, my husband loved this one! I'd give it an a-okay! Tenderness was perfect,  though I thought seasoning could be more interesting BAJA FISH  - really good! Not too fishy. Perfect texture. Lots of flavor VEGGIE - my husband was a big fan of this one CRISPY FISH- very good! Not overly breaded, perfect amount of crisp. CHIPOTLE SHRIMP - my personal favorite! One of the best shrimp tacos I've had. It does have a bit of a kick. CARNITAS - very good! Tender meat and lots of flavorAll in all, their fish tacos were my favorite!  The salsa that came with the chips was really good. The verde was creamy with a bit of spice. The red salsa was mild with smokey tomato flavors.The blood orange margarita was bomb! I will deff be ordering that again. The joy house margarita was good, but a bit tart (tasted like a lemonade margarita). They even acknowledged my nut allergy,  which I had noted while online ordering,  and wrote it on all the boxes are food came in. I will be back. Can't wait to dine in here when more comfortable with COVID numbers.Useful 3Funny 1Cool 3Business owner informationBailey U.Business Owner8/17/2020Thank you Liz!

"Kayla R.Elite '2021Henderson, NV320935145393/24/20211 photo1 check-inCame here on the first night we were in town visiting friends. They asked if we wanted Taco Tuesday? Uhhh duh.We arrived here somewhat later on, maybe around 7 or 8, and they were POPPIN! Definitely recommend getting here on the earlier side. They have a sweet deal for tacos & margaritas on Tuesdays that honestly, I don't know if they can be beat. The wait was about and hour and a half, so we put our names in and thought if anything, we could go grab dinner elsewhere and then head over back to Joyride Taco House for a nightcap margarita.As soon as we finished dinner down the street, we got a text that our table was ready at Joyride. Perfect timing! We walked back over and were seated in a booth. The inside of this place is also so very Arizona. Super cute. I loved it. The bathroom even goes with the theme and had a stoplight in it. Truly amazing atmosphere here. Our server was very attentive. We told her basically we were there to drink some margaritas and not really eat anything except some chips and guac, and she was super cool about it! I ended up ordering a Ranch Water because I wanted to try it out. Our server explained it to us as basically a margarita this is sparkling. I ordered the pomegranate one. It was super delicious but I always forget that sparkling drinks sometimes mess with my stomach. So for the next round, I ordered an original margarita on the rocks with salt. They have some pretty tasty margaritas here.To keep the party going and the fact that I was on vacay, I ordered us all shots of tequila. Let me tell you, when you order a shot from here, the pour is extremely generous. It was more like a full drink. You get what you pay for, and no complaints there!We ended up staying till they closed and even a little after while we waited for our Uber. No one came over to rush us out. It was so nice. They even turned on the lights and started cleaning and still, no one told us to leave. That's some good customer service right there. Eventually we decided we shouldn't make them come over to tell us to leave, so we got up and waited outside for our driver.I definitely would love to come back here again next time I'm in town and hit them up for the tacos, because I saw others ordering those and they looked delicious.Ranch waterUseful 30Funny 10Cool 24Business owner informationBailey U.Business Owner3/25/2021Thanks for hanging out with us!Read more",Business owner informationBailey U.Business Owner3/25/2021Thanks for hanging out with us!Read more

"Ricky D.Phoenix, AZ30561610/8/2015Everyone, heads up!I used be a loyal customer of Water Mill Express because they service the machines daily, clean and convinient but recently noticed the water tasted off and also noticed the daily service stickers are missing. Checked other locations too. Tried to contact by phone as before but no longer an option, only Email. So I wrote them about my concerns and they just side stepped my questions and said they would send me some free tokens that I didn't ask for. That was 2 weeks ago. No tokens.My summation is that they no longer service the machines daily as before and am now going to a nearby Water Store. It's a little more expensive and not as convenient but at least I know the water is good quality and tastes better too! I recommend you all do the same!!!
