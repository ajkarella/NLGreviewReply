"Hey Elbert, That is not the experience we wanted you to have and we want to look into this for you. Could you please email us at caraguestservices@cara.c… and cite reference number: 31378. We look forward to hearing from you."
" Sorento in for service and was greeted with a big smile and hand shake. The car needed an oil change and tire rotation, they explained the process and had me sit in the customer lounge. The lounge is AWESOME, nice furniture, free WIFI and a nice selection of coffee's and snacks. I made a Starbucks with the coffee machine and grabbed a granola bar and about 50 min later they had completed my service. The car was washed and they even swept it out. I definitely think this is a great place to do business and could be a great place to work.See all photos from Shea S. for Ken Ganley KiaUseful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationNikolaus N.Business Manager9/5/2017Shea, we appreciate you taking the time to share your review!

"I needed a last minute oil change on the day before Thanksgiving and they were able to fit me in. I was okay with the oil change and I also had them take a quick look at 2 lights that were on, and the diagnostic fee would have been 129 to hook it up and diagnose. The fee did not apply to the actual price of the repair. Because of this reason I opted to to not have it diagnosed there. It didnt take too long for the oil change the amenities while waiting were comfortable.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationPep B.Business Owner12/14/2018We're glad you had a good experience Tammera.

"Hi Ervin, I'm terribly sorry you feel this way about us. First off I'd like to say we do not make our juices and our providers tell us they are a 70/30 vg/pg mix. Second juice is preference based, different for everybody so I'm also sorry again you do not like our juice :(, but others do. Third, I will agree that our 3mg is slightly stronger than most 3's out there, but if you would like to come try a 6mg I guarantee you it will be stronger than the juice you just purchased. Fourth, I am that ""other guy"" and would like to say sorry for not noticing you said good morning, I simply did not want to interrupt your conversation with my partner, and if it was in the morning I had work to do on the computer so I apologize again though no excuses should be made, we didn't mean to make it unwelcoming for you. Happy vaping!"
".  The location is great.  I really loved the neighborhood.  Being able to walk my dog every morning and evening on the greenway was a treat.  The complex was ok.  The security gates on the parking lots always worked but 50% of the sidewalk gates were broken.  Not nice to know the complex wasn't secure but, nice to not have to carry my keys when out walking the dog.  The pools were always clean and the landscaping was cared for.The unit I moved into was extremely dated.  Old carpet, ancient kitchen appliances, and terrible windows.  It also turned out to have a major roach (water bug) infestation.  How they hid it when I did my walk through, I don't know. Pest control was in my apartment every other week - spraying, drilling holes in the walls and fogging, doing everything they could do - but the bugs wouldn't go.  The living room window leaked water when rain water would run down the front of the building.  Luckily, the outgoing management let me out of my lease before the new management came in.  The roaches avoided my bedroom, which I thought was awfully nice of them.  To be fair, my neighbors claimed to not have the same level of roach infestation that I did.  People on the second floor, directly above my unit, claimed to have never even seen a roach before!  Guess I was just lucky.Minus the bugs, I liked the apartment and the management was very responsive.  It was really quiet and my neighbors were very nice.  Price wise, considering the dated fixtures and bug problem, I paid too much for that little one bedroom.  I went into the complex a few weeks ago to visit a friend and saw that they had my old unit torn apart.  Hopefully its been completely gutted, not just cleaned to turn it over again and let another poor soul deal with the infestation.Useful 6Funny 1CoolBusiness owner informationErica M.Business Owner3/8/2015Thank you for taking the time to make a review.  We are sorry that we were not able to make the bug issue go away for you but we are happy that we were able to come to a solution that both parties were happy with.  We are doing some great renovations to the interior of the apartments that make a huge improvement.  Next time you are in the area visiting your friend, stop in the office and take a look for yourself.  Thank you again for the review."

"Hi Shari,  I'm Angela, owner of The Cocoa Palette.  I wanted to thank you for your feedback and also provide some clarification to your experience.  I do apologize for the unsatisfactory service you received when picking up your order.  The girls running the booth were a last minute substitute for the gal normally there and they were not as familiar with the policies, etc.  When they reached me by phone (I was running a booth at a different market), I had asked them to communicate to you that I'd be happy to redeem the remainder of your voucher but the items do have to be pre-ordered, as detailed in the fine print of the Living Social.  There must have been a miscommunication in the correspondence, as I realize they seemed to communicate a different message than this to you.You expressed the truffles weren't to your liking due to weak flavors and I do appreciate this feedback.  We're a very new business and are constantly working on making improvements to our products.Please contact me directly at 480-719-0707 or orders@thecocoapalette.c… and I'd be happy to get you the remainder of the value you paid for with free delivery to you at your convenience.  If you're not wanting the truffles again, we do have bark, bars, brownies, marshmallows, and other sweets you can apply it towards."

"Hi Phoebe,I'm so sorry your experience did not meet your expectations.  We try our best to limit the noise and our rooms have extra soundproofing, but it is certainly not a spa environment if that is what you were hoping for.  We are a medical office and our massages are more for therapy than for relaxation.  We do care about your feedback, however, and we are reviewing ways we can limit the external sound.  We are also reviewing the wording on the Groupon to make it more clear that the 90 min massage includes 5 min. changing time before and after the massage.  Actual massage time is 80 min.  Please message me so we can find a way to make it up to you."
We are sooo grateful for you Warren! Thank you for being so open and sharing your journey and what you have already overcome and conquered! I cannot wait to see what the next 6 months will hold!

"Hello, we apologize for this and wish there was something we could do to fix this.  Our venue was bought out by a third party for this event so we had zero control over the management of the event in question.  Furthermore the pictures posted on this review were at Dorian, not Blind Dragon, which is a totally different business. Please contact the event coordinators to follow up.  Thank you.Andrew NavarroGeneral Manager | Blind Dragon ScottsdaleMobile: 602.828.8694 | Email: anavarro@hhgaz.com"
"Hey Terrence, as we mentioned with the other negative reviews from the other people in your party, we fully accept responsibility for dropping the ball during your visit.  Although we were understaffed during your visit, we're not hiding behind excuses at all, we recognize that your experience should have been considerably better than it was.Keep in mind that it's a very common practice to ask for a review to be removed once we have all come to an agreement and put this situation behind us.  This is the normal process that almost all bars and restaurants use.We're more than happy to refund your room fees but we'd like to also make sure you are interested in actually coming to a resolution and not just interested in writing additional negative reviews.  If you'd like to discuss in person please reach out to me at your convenience.  Thank you.Andrew Navarro General Manager | Blind Dragon Scottsdale Mobile: 602.828.8694 | Email: anavarro@hhgaz.com"

"We are sorry for your disappointment. Take off shellac is $10.00,and it takes about 20-25 minutes to finish. The girl accidently told you $5.00, and the manager just corrected $10.00 ( because $5.00 is not enought to cover for rent, labour work, and other expenses) but you did not want to pay $10.00, so we could not finish the job."

"Jim,I would love to chat. This is a Farmers issue that I can't fix. I understand you don't want to chat on the phone however as you read all my reviews say they met me in person. A 3 star review isn't horrible but I would like the ability to earn your business and earn a 5 star review (I hope). I am happy to do a face to face as I never write insurance over email or rarely over the phone. Insurance is never written properly over the phone or email. Discounts are always missing, coverages are always missing. I almost died July 2, 2002 from an 89yr old man running a stop sign. I learned very quickly how insurance is supposed to be written. My settlement check, almost dying was $7,147 which was supposed to cover my injuries forever. I suffer headache 3-6 times a week, so far for 18 years. That $7,147 is a joke. I explain all this in an appt. This is why I don't recommend a phone or email insurance policy. At the end of the day, clients decide what they want after they have been educated. Please, lets do a face to face, or I will ask to update a review. 3 stars hurts our agency.

"By far the worst experience with the waitresses & customer attentiveness. My husband & I were seated, our waitress came by & told us about the drinks & left because we wanted a chance to look at the menu. She never came back! She walked past our table several times (5x) no acknowledgment as to if we we were ready to order, after 27mins of waiting we left & went to Native New Yorker. Which was the opposite of what we experienced @ zipps! We were very disappointed with the fact we were ignored multiple times & there's no excuse! She saw us & choose to service her other bigger tables instead. As a former waitress for several years, you should be attentive to everyone because not all big parties tip well-its all about servicing your customers & being attentive to their request! Hopefully the owner sees this...UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationTiffany D.Business Customer Service5/20/2021Dear Jasmin, Thank you for the feedback, we are very sorry to hear about your experience!

"Hi Bill,I’m sorry to hear you feel you had this experience but are you confident you have the right wash? As you can see from our stellar 4.5+ star reviews on all social media, we are NOT just another wash. We are a family owned business and I am personally on site almost every single day. We use 100% fresh, reverse osmosis and deionized water and spend more on our chemistry than any other wash in the state. We are the exclusive developers of our very own Ceramic Shield Process and have a chemical cost that is approximately 2x higher than your average operator. As car fanatics, we obsess with being the best and ensuring our process cleans, shines and protects your vehicle. We would love to invite you back to the wash to come tour our facility as well as give you a Ceramic Shield Process on us so we can educate you all about everything that goes into it. Give us the chance, and I assure you we can change your mind. Just ask for myself or Dustin when you come back by!Thank you,David MillerOwner, Wash Werks"

" I bought a 1995 Cadillac El Dorado. It's not many people's dream cars but I'm unlike many people. I brought it to Coulter to be serviced on January 11th and was assisted by Jason Thatcher. Jason was super professional, knowledgeable, and very honest in his approach. He told me my service would take 2 hours, which it did. Thankfully my Caddy got a clean bill of health although he did have some recommendations for me to keep an eye on that I'll probably have Coulter do in the future.It's always nice to be surprised by a dealer's service department.Thanks Jason and thanks Coulter.Useful 2FunnyCool 1Business owner informationCoulter A.Business Customer Service1/19/2021Thank you for your kind words and compliments to Jason and the team!

"Our apologies but the manager was not able to help you because he had just literally walked in the door and was looking to see what was going on. He had to help employee cooking food and help make sure that the stuff in the oven was not burning. As soon as he finished making sure the food was not burnt he walked up and saw that you needed to be served in the barista was able to finally help you. Our apologies we were a little shorthanded today due to call off, which is why the manager came in so early before his shift to help. Since you've worked in a place like this before I'm sure you could understand maybe you don't realize what entirely going on behind-the-scenes."

Thank you for returning and I hope you come again and try some of our most recent winter warmer dishes such as -Shepherd's Pie.7/15/2011Previous reviewWent to meet a friend for lunch today and decided to try the Spanish Omelette this time. It was very good - definitely rich and creamy.  The potatoes were not exactly what I was expecting but they were good. Instead of traditional home fries or hash browns, these potatoes were shredded and baked in creamy/cheesy casserole style. In addition to potatoes, it also included a small cup of fruit and your choice of toast.  It is a lot  of food so take your appetite with your (or do like I did and take half of it home for later!)  My friend got the cranberry pecan belgian waffle and it looked outstanding! Again, I was pleased with the quality of the food and the service was fine on this visit as well.5/28/2011Previous reviewJust went back for my second visit - I would say this place really rates 3.5 stars but not quite a 4.    The first visit was during the week  at lunch time and today's visit was Saturday at around 10:50.  On both visits, our wait time was under 10 minutes.  (However, we once tried to go once on a Sunday and the line was out the door so we didn't even try to get in.) The place is open, sunny and cheery with a sort of country-kitchen  decor. The service has been so-so on both of my visits, but not terrible.  But no matter, the food  was good.  Today I had blueberry-banana whole wheat pancakes with scrambled eggs. The dish also comes with 2 pieces of thick-cut smokehouse bacon.  However since I don't eat pork, I asked for the chicken apple sausage in lieu of the bacon.  The pancakes had good flavor and texture. (The syrup was decent, but they really should serve pure maple without charging extra for it.)  The scrambled eggs were tasty with a nice texture and the sausage had nice flavor and textrure as well. David ordered the potato pancakes with scrambled egg whites and pork sausage.  He thought the potato-pancakes were pretty good but he prefers applesauce rather than the diced apples (just a personal preference on his part).   The coffee is decent - not the best in the world, and not the worst.  We do like the fact that they bring a carafe to your table so you don't have to wait for refills. (This is a big deal for me & David - we need our coffee!) The only thing that almost ruined today's experience for me was the fact that after our orders were put in, our server came over and told me that there would be a charge for substituting the chicken sausage for the bacon.  I said that was fine.  But he didn't explain what he really meant is that I would be charged for the plate (including the bacon) plus charged for a side order of chicken sausage (despite the fact that I did not get  bacon - If I had known that, I would have just kept the bacon on my plate - to give to David - and ordered a side of Chicken Sausage).  Now, don't get me wrong,  I have no problem paying an ""upcharge"" when the item I want to substitute costs MORE than the item that comes on the plate... but when the item I wanted costs LESS than the item that I asking to leave off, I think it is silly for the restaurant to charge more.  (Plus, it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth and makes me think twice about whether I want to go back or not.) In the case of the bacon here- (which I did NOT want ) - a side order costs $3.95 while a side of the chicken sausage costs $3.50.  We did complain at the checkout and said that we were willing to pay a ""upcharge""  but we did not think it was fair to simply be charged for a side order of chicken sausage when we didn't also get the bacon.  So, the hostess/manager quickly took care of it  and took the extra charge off our bill. I thanked her for taking care of it, but I have to say the restaurant needs to rethink their policy because a lot of people may have just walked away angry. The prices were pretty standard  for breakfast places that we frequent  (between $26 - $28 for 2 before tip)."

"Jeff, we've been in business a long time now, and we wouldn't be able to say that if we did anything like the shady practices you're describing here. Please understand that whether you're dealing with a phone repair shop, an auto repair shop, or really any kind of business in any kind of industry whatsoever, there's a reason why the popular term used is ""estimate"" rather than ""guarantee."" Every technician gives an estimate for how long they think a repair or job will take, but that estimate is exactly what it sounds like: an honest approximation of the time, parts, labor, and costs involved. Once the phone is opened up -- just like a car, an air conditioner, a computer, or whatever -- there's always a possibility that the expert will learn more about the problem at hand, and this new information can alter the original timing of the estimate. While we can understand how that'd be frustrating from a consumer's standpoint, it's also the reality of practically every industry and business on earth. We hope you can understand this even if you can't appreciate it, and we wish you all the best moving forward.Respectfully,Mason Lambert, Manager5/5/2020Previous reviewI went here because they told me they could have my phone fixed on a Saturday. I gave them a deposit so they could order my parts. Well, saturday came and went and no phone call to bring my phone in. It's now Tuesday, still no call. I called them to ask that they refund my deposit and they refused! Be cautious if you use this place and DO NOT give them a deposit. They have lost my business."

". They appear luxurious from the outside but don't be deceived, they are very cheaply built with shoddy construction. The floorboards were peeling up, our garage motor fell down because they used nails instead of screws not to mention our countertops were not secure. Three doors down a neighbor has already had problems with a termite infestation. They are overpriced for the value you receive. The amenities? Little to none. Only a small pool without a Jacuzzi. The location is in great proximity to campus for ASU students but the surrounding neighborhoods are not the best. I've had  packages stolen from the front door and multiple items stolen out of the garage. The trash pickup has been an issue from day one. Many times, it is left sitting outside for days and no one picks it up while the homeless scavenge through it. The trash guy claims he's too good to pick up a pizza or amazon box when we pay 30 dollars a month for the trash pickup service. May 2017, NorthStar Property Management took over out of Tucson. Google their reviews for yourself. Since NorthStar took over, no one is ever in the front office. The new leasing manager lacks communication, rarely responding to emails, calls, or texts. It is very frustrating when you are trying to get things accomplished. I do not recommend living here until they make some drastic changes. There are a ton of other town home communities in Tempe that offer better value. Do your research and live elsewhere.Useful 5Funny 1CoolBusiness owner informationNorthStar M.Business Owner9/28/2017Hi Alec, thanks for taking the time to write us a review.We are sorry to hear you had some issues when you first moved in. With any newer construction inevitably there will need to be some minor repairs as the first wave of residents start settling in. We're not showing any current or pending work orders for your apartment, so it appears the previous management has addressed those issues for you. If you still have anything needing fixed, please let us know right away. Also we're sorry to hear you were having trouble reaching our manager, the hours that we are available is clearly posted on the front door of the office. Please remember that because of the smaller size of this community that there is not usually someone physically stationed at the office on a regular schedule (the same went for the previous management company). All showings/tours/repairs/etc are all by appointment only. Our property manager also manages another property that is only minutes away, so she can get to the property fairly quickly if needed.If for any reason our manager can't answer the phone, please leave us a voicemail and we'll return your call right away. Please be sure you are using the new office number which is (480) 757-4117, please reach out to us anytime.To address your issue with the trash being left by your door, looking at the community rules, it does appear that while the property does offer an 'at-your-door trash pickup service', all trash must be bagged and tied. Throwing out old pizza boxes on the ground in front of your apartment and leaving them there is actually a violation of our community policies. If you have any questions regarding our trash service, please let our office manager know. Again thanks for taking the time to write us a review, please let us know if you need any further assistance,John HisermanNorthStar Management & Consulting, Inc."
"Hayden, we apologize for any inconvenience or lack of service.  We are actually in day 2 of a new cook/chef.That should only explain the wait.  But, he was making a delivery as other staff couldn’t drive, and the staff there has been on record, slower then we are comfortable.  I can’t make sense of the smoothie issue, and will address that with them, and hopefully correct immediately.Please find your way back to us this weekend, I plan to be there all day Sunday, and would love to provide you a better experience than you had today.In all honesty, this review helps me make the hard decisions, as the service has been subpar, and will be addressed, as current employees are about to be shown how to appropriately serve guests, or be asked to leave.  You can email me, I would love to chat and offer a solution to your experience.Thank you,MMG ownership."
"You may feel it is “not relevant” but that’s a huge point in your frustration.You ordered at 10:10 to pick up at 11:10.We don’t open until 10:30, which means everything we made for you was fresh and ready in a short period of time after you placed the online order.Quick note, cooked food can stay out in a controlled environment, and when prepared hot, should not be put into a fridge until after it has had a chance to cool to acceptable temps for prevention of bacateria build up in a hot to immediate cold environment.Keith, I’ve met you several times, and you have been a customer for a few meal plan orders as well as several take out orders.  There has never been an issue, you’ve made me aware of, in the past.We take the time to make your order and have it ready, fresh for when you ask.  11:10.  It was ready at 11:10am.  I know as I helped make it, before leaving at 11am for a catering delivery.  I am sorry the interaction with my cook, Justin, was misinformed or misleading or incorrect.  And his commitment to you shouldn’t have given the impression we could take the food back.  I do wish you would have reached me directly for a resolution and explanation before committing this amount of time to social media, with incorrect and false claims about us as a company.The manager, with glasses, is an owner, and was told to shut up by you girlfriend, when explaining the situation.  That’s not a way to resolve a situation.  Nor should there be an expectation that you can order fresh cooked food, and we would Immediately refrigerate it.  You came later than you initially claimed when you placed your order, and are now frustrated and complaining it needed to be remade without cost, where we don’t have refrigeration to store everyone’s meals that get ordered. If you wouldn’t have picked up for several more hours, we would have put in the fridge for you.  But your food was out of 90 minutes in containers in bags, awaiting your arrival.  We are a business, and as a customer for a year, you would hopefully appreciate our service and quality.  But after a year, you chose to open forum bad mouth is based on your late arrival and repercussions subsequently following.I apologize you feel wronged.  But my staff and co-Owner are instructed we cannot take food back, that has already left the building.   Also, they are instructed they should not tolerate disrespect from a customer when it’s given, as your girlfriend was clearly aggressive in her communication.Regardless,  sorry for your experience.  And if refrigerated food is your preference, as you mentioned there is plenty of options in town.  We are sorry to lose your business, but understand your position.Lastly, if you knew you were going to be late, and not make it at 11:10 as you agreed when placing the order, you could always call and ask us to put in fridge until you arrived, if it was as serious as it now seems to be.We wish this ended differently, but also understand what decisions are needed to be made.Thank you,Cole C.Your comment deserved better attention, and sorry for that, but your girlfriends is blatantly not worthy of civility.I don’t disagree with the outcome, as we couldn’t take the food back and just remake yours (for anyone reading it was a large meal plan, not just one item) But we couldn’t spoken directly, as we have many times, and handled it.  There was and is nothing wrong with that food.  Hope you at least are enjoying it after all this."
Thank you so much Joanne! Hope to do business with you again :)

"Thank you for coming in, Samson. We understand that you were unsatisfied with your service after your second haircut at our salon. We had no issues addressing any questions during the service; in fact we love to educate our guests on our services and products used to maintain their look. We will check in with our guests if we feel the guest is showing signs of uneasiness or continuously interrupts the service. We understand that you need constant verification and reassurance about your haircut while it is being cut. We want to ensure the best quality outcome for our clients, especially if a guest has expressed dissatisfaction elsewhere. With that being said, we charge for our time and we will always inform our guests ahead of time if the standard price changes. We understand that telling you the price before you pay and setting the expectation for the service made you feel uncomfortable. We understand these things are difficult to discern and can be stressful, which is why the I had to help Leah explain the expectation and price for the service. We always strive to provide clarity in this area for guests to have a good service and enjoy their experience. We’re sorry that you see this as “bizarre, unprofessional (and) rude..” You were given two awesome haircuts. We will go ahead and cancel your third pre-booked appointment and wish you the best of luck in finding a salon home."
"Jason, we are so sorry you felt this way and had this experience. With your review on cardio equipment and dumbbells, it sounds as though you are referring to the Blue Diamond location. We would like to welcome you back in for a new experience! Our cleaning staff is asked to remain as unseen and non-invasive as possible to make it less crowded. Our other locations are great too! If more cardio equipment and smaller weights is what you are looking for, our Rainbow location sounds like it could have JUST what you need. Come give it a try!"

Sorry for your experience.  I don't recall the specifics of your move but I can say that we always use a 6 inch non marking fixed wheeled dolly that has about a 10 inch clearance off the ground. After 23 plus years of move with similar dollies I don't recall ever having damage to a front leg.  Usually I tighten up loose legs improving them before placing it carefully back down.  If you should ever feel comfortable having me out to tune I'd gladly take a look at anything you feel may not have already been there. Completely understand if you don't and once again sorry for your experience and do hope to earn your business again someday. All the best.

"Hi and I want to thank you for commenting. I am very proud of the food service and ambiance we offer at PIZZUTTI'S and I do not get to go on line to check for reviews as much as I should. No big corporation here. PIZZUTTI'S does every thing with love and a devotion to delight our guests.  Had I seen your comments, I would have mentioned that we have never done a sweet potato and goat cheese ravioli and our menu has never included gnocchi with Alfredo Sauce. I am confused. If you asked for gnocchi with an Alfredo sauce we would accomodate, but it has never been on my menu. I am  happy you came to PIZZUTTI'S and we look forward to serving you again soon!Introduce yourself when you are in and I will be more than happy to talk with you about your thoughts and our menu choices."

First of all thanks for the feedback and comment. We totally agree that what the employee did was completely wrong.We rarely have a negative Review Since we opened 10 years ago and suddenly in 2013 we started getting some Negative reviews about this Location. The problem was the management and staff and as of 2014 we have taken care of this problem. We now have completely new Management and New staff at this location.  All the new staff is now trained by franchise company directly and they are making sure on a regular basis of what's going on with this Restaurant.

"I have attempted to reach out to you to discuss your review but you haven't responded. Your review is very troubling as we do not represent people in disputes over phone bills or phone calls. Having looked into your case, I see that we did not represent you in that type of case. Your case was much more serious. Unfortunately, our ethics do not allow me to post the pleadings and all of the details of your case here so that Yelp users can make their own determination as to whether you received good service. Anyone that has used Sean as an attorney or that knows him personally knows that he would never use a phrase like ""easy as pie"". Lawyers are a highly regulated group and we never guarantee results. We even go as far a to have clients sign a contract acknowledging that we cannot guarantee the results. Settlement is always the right of the client. If an attorney tells you that you should consider settling the case, it's because the facts of the case mean that you can get a better deal by reaching an agreement that going in front of the judge. Your case was greatly impacted by your decision to move four hours away in the middle of your case. It's my recollection that Sean actually left our family vacation and met you to sign the settlement agreement so that you wouldn't have to drive four hours back to our office to sign it. Most people would consider that excellent service. It's also troubling that you didn't post this review until almost a year after your case had closed. We appreciate constructive criticism and feedback from clients. It helps us improve and become better lawyers.  We wish you the best of luck in the future. Angela McIlveen"

"Hi Sooze - We greatly appreciate your feedback and I'm sincerely sorry to hear about the experience you had. A couple things I want to apologize about. 1) Taking so long to respond to this, for some reason the notification didn't come through and 2) For not being more clear on what number accepts texts (we'll fix this). Looking at the 702 number in the photo that is our landline number. The number we use for texts is (915) 493-3165 and that goes directly to me. Your experience is definitely out of character for the type of work we perform and the level of service we provide.If you're up for it, please reach out to me directly at either number and ask for Nicky.I hope to hear back from you and again so we can have the chance to make this right. I apologize about the delay in getting back to you.Nicky (owner)Emporium Nails Spa"
"I had a statement in my contract that used the term ""Chinese coronavirus"" and my protocol for Inspections in regard to it. That was a term initially used and still used but I have changed the language because it apparently offends snowflakes like this fellow.Here was my exact reply to him in a text when he canceled the inspection with less than 24 hours notice after reading my contact and getting his feelings hurt.""... ever heard of the Spanish flu? The Hong Kong flu? Yellow fever? Ebola (a river in Africa)? The Marburg (a place in Germany) virus? MERS (look it up to see what that stands for). What about Chinese food? Mexican food?  My Lord! Everything doesn't have to be so controversial! breitbart.com/the-media/… ""That's it. Let the reader be the judge of who has a problem."
"I do not know and I've never heard of this person. I've had absolutely no business relationship or conversation with this person whatsoever. He is obviously a good friend of Jarod M.,who is intent on doing all he can to damage the business of someone who doesn't have the same world view as him. Childish people. I will be asking Yelp to remove this bogus post."
"The complainer is the wife of the person I dealt with. She doesn't have all the facts. If I was rude with her husband from the time he contacted me why did he want me to do his inspection and why write a nasty review when I didn't???? He received a docusign contract at least TWELVE hours in advance of the inspection, the evening before the inspection, which had been planned about a week in advance. Honestly, I should have sent him the contract well in advance and that was an oversight on my part because I was so busy. When I realized I had forgotten to send him the contact, I contacted him and informed him of the oversight and told him to look for it in his email. I sent him a text the night before asking him to check his email and sign the contract. He could have signed it on his phone in 5 minutes! The morning of the inspection he informed me by text at 5:30 a.m. that he needed to postpone (because he didn't have time to read a one page contract). (A cancellation at the last minute is very rude to a business owner. I had to sit home that half a day and earned no income. Quite frankly I don't want to work for the type of person who wants to postpone at the last minute and thinks that's OK.) I told him my calendar was full for the next week and I could not postpone and he would have to find somebody else. (The beautiful thing about America is that he can hire whomever he wants, and, I don't have to work for people who treat me badly.) The bottom line is HE NEVER SIGNED THE CONTRACT and that is why he didn't get the inspection that he wanted. Let the reader go to Angie's List to read reviews from 200+ satisfied customers who didn't cancel at the last minute."

Hi Amber. I apologize that I'm just seeing of this experience. I don't recall hearing of this at the Center.

No excuse if there was a time screw-up. Our General Manager will be reaching out to you.

I’m sorry you feel you did not have a good experience with me. I pride myself on good customer service. One thing you did not see is that I have sanitizer on my counter and use it repeatedly during the service and between going from the hands back to the face I use sanitizer and a hot towel to clean my hands. You experienced a purge after a facial that is not a reaction. A reaction after a facial is hives or severely swollen skin due to a reaction to a product. Breakout can be expected sometimes after a facial especially a hydrating facial like you got. Now as far as touching the door handle- since I had completely sanitizer it prior to your arrival I did not think to change my gloves but I did sanitize them but I will remember to change them in the future.  Normally when a new client comes in I go through a list of everything we are going to do but because I thought I did you the month before  I thought I would let you relax during the treatment during the treatment since I thought I already did that with you. .

We are glad we were able to answer your questions and give some helpful advice as we understand dealing with this type of situation can be very stressful and challenging. Do not hesitate to contact us again if, in the future, there is anything you need from us. We are always happy to help in any way we can."
"Thank you for taking the time to review our firm. I'm sorry we weren't able to provide you with what you were looking for, unfortunately no law firm could. The reason why you were referred by two of your friends is that we get amazing results for our clients by doing hard work on their behalf. More importantly we don't sugar coat or lie to our clients. In your case, we were able to provide you with two viable options, take a really good reduced plea offer from the State or execute a trial strategy that we spent the better part of a year preparing (which is why we got the good plea offer). We even offered to reduce the trial fee for you because of financial difficulties you were having. The fact that you're a single mom didn't move the Prosecutors to dismiss your case, frankly it shouldn't. Like I explained to you on the phone, we can't change what happened. We can, however, provide you with options that you didn't have before retaining our services. We certainly did that. It saddens me that you weren't more pleased with the hard work we put into your case and fruits of that labor. Best of luck to you in the future."

"In response to David K's comments:   I always quote the price up front, before ever scheduling a service appointment.  The price is $175 to flush RV holding tanks, and is a flat rate for all types of RV's, and has been the price for 5 years.  We always enter the tanks from the outside unless otherwise requested by the customer, or when there is a clog that requires special attention.  The pressure applied to the flushing is regulated and non-damaging.  Prior to any service, and to protect both the customer and Daisy Fresh, a form is required to be signed outlining specifically our services and procedures.  We regret that you were not satisfied with our services, and you failed to contact us immediately so we could rectify any concerns.  We have thousands of customers who have been very pleased with our services, and who return time and again.Daisy Fresh RV Flush"
"The food was excellent, however the service was seriously lacking. We came to celebrate a birthday and did a great amount of research before booking a restaurant to celebrate. Upon reservation and with the hostess my fiancé made sure to say this was for a birthday. There was no acknowledgment even though others in the restaurant received special recognition of birthdays. We would not come back here for a celebration or for dinner. Felt ignored by our server, but other tables were getting plenty of attention. We literally had to put our hand up and yell excuse me for assistance. I don't know if this had to do with the face that we are from the states or that we are in our 30?? Really disappointing service. Definitely would not recommend again. Maybe for take out??Useful 3Funny 1CoolBusiness owner informationRandy O.Business Manager3/15/2018Dear Meghan V.,Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us regarding your recent visit at Hy's Toronto.  I am very sorry that your evening fell so far below your expectations, and our usually very high standards.  We know how much time guests put into selecting restaurants to celebrate their special events, which is why we always try to make these occasions extra special.  I won't make excuses for your experience, we have a professional team, and our job is to ensure that our service is as prompt and seamless as possible for each and every one of our tables.

Me and my relatives were assigned lane 5, and the bowling lane was low quality. The oil on the lane wasn't active and couldn't curve. I'm not sure if it affected other lanes but it was absolutely terrible. Second, the bowling pins wouldn't just wouldn't go down. We only striked once when it was 16 pound ball with 14mph and very rarely spared. The bumpers also were just here and didn't do its job as ""bumpers"". Finally, the attitude. I'm not sure if it was this exclusive but he asked if we had a credit card and said no, he sounded really pissed off. He said he'd ""let it slide this time"" but had annoyance in his tone. tl;dr Bad attitude towards customers and little to no oil on lanes, bowling pins heavy"

"We got a good price and the Camry we had ran beautifully.  So why two stars?  The agent tried to charge us almost a $100 more than our reservation was for.  Once that was corrected, he showed me the car.  It needed washing and vacuuming.  He washed and vacuumed it.  It was dripping wet - hadn't been dried.  We inspected the car, noting the one significant scratch, and went on our way.  About a half our down the road, we noticed the smell of cigarette smoke.  It became obvious that someone had smoked in the car and that the company had done nothing to mitigate that.  I also noticed that the gas gauge was on 3/4, not full.  Guess I need to check that rather than trust that a company like Enterprise would fill the tank or note it on the rental agreement.  They did neither.  The next day, we drove west in the morning, meaning the sun was shining on the rear of the car.  The inside of the back window was so covered with dirt, grime, and film that it was impossible to see out the back in the rearview mirror.  Finally, one of the features of the car I found while playing with the controls was the tire pressure monitor.  According to the monitor the pressures were 36 (LR), 38 (RR), 39 (RF) and 40 (LF).  Being that out of balance and that overinflated indicates a potential safety problem to me.  Obviously, Enterprise does not check tire inflation.  Again, the car was otherwise excellent, we were finally charged what we were supposed to be charged, and had an excellent 10 day trip.  I would go back here, but would be a real pain in the butt about checking our the car including making them check tire pressure before I got in.Useful 3FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationEnterprise R.Business Owner5/7/2016Thank you for your review, Sid.

Beth - I bought this shop last year and I understand why you would rate them so low.I have fired all the staff employed experts and invested a lot of money in getting a smoke shop that offers amazing prices and real quality of productsI would like to ask you if you can remove the rating as I am not responsible for that terrible shop owner who was running if before. All the staff are really cool now and know their stuff and we guarantee the quality of any product you buy - if you come in I will give you 20% discount.

"One of the slowest and most boring rounds of golf we've played in quite awhile. They start groups off every 8 minutes which guarantees backups along the way. We actually quit after 13 holes, a first for us, and we'd been out for 3 hours and 20 minutes. At that rate it would be dark when we finished. This is a flat track without much character. One long straight flat hole after another. With so many interesting courses around, can't imagine why people play here.All that said, the greens were in great shape and the staff was friendly and accommodating.Useful 1FunnyCool 1Business owner informationBailey H.Business Owner11/25/2020Hello Kim,Thank you for your feedback, and I'm sorry to hear about your experience yesterday and that we let you down.  After looking into it a little further, the groups that tee'd off before and after you finished in 4 hours and 30 minutes.  I know this isn't acceptable for everyone but we take a very proactive approach to maintaining pace of play so that all of our guests have a great experience even when we are sold out like yesterday.  I hope you come back and give us another chance to make it up to you.  If you have any further comments or concerns please give me a call anytime on my cell phone at (925)-980-1006Best,Andrew FrazierDirector of Sales and ServicesDobson Ranch Golf Course"

"Hi Desiree,If you can email me personally—I’d like to see what’s going on to help remedy your situation. My email is Dimitri.Apostle@brightwa… . Brightway Insurance is a franchise and there are over 200 offices across the country. I’ll help you find the right office and help provide a resolution!"
"I appreciate your feedback and dealing with the DMV, in this situation, was extremely frustrating for you and for us, please allow me to clear some items up below.1) Melissa, on my service team faxed the DMV proof of liability on 2/21 and called back on 2/22 where she spoke with Camille. She indicated to us that it had been received and NC DMV would clear the file. You brought to our attention another letter you received. Melissa then spoke to Allen at the DMV, on 4/24, who stated ""to resend to him and he would add clearer notes in the the system regarding the letter the insured received"". Melissa then faxed them again on 4/24. I then faxed the NC DMV on 6/12 and called and spoke to Ann with you on a conference call so that you were comfortable knowing everything had finally been cleared. You did NOT incur any fees with the state.2) You weren't overcharged for your vehicle insurance. I had emailed you a cancellation form to sign on 6/12, you sent it back to us on 6/14. It was too late to stop the automatic payment as the request was sent to the bank to withdraw the funds for the amount due. I informed you that you could go to the bank and reject the transaction, but you indicated "" you were too busy"". So my office emailed you to inform you the refund check would be mailed to you in 7-10 business days.3) First, I've NEVER said I was too busy to work on your issues. On 5/3/2016 we received a fax from Danielle Daniels, from your mortgage company, to update the loan number, which we did. Apparently the mortgage company made an error and sent us the wrong loan #. We received the correct loan# from Kelly on 5/4/17 and promptly sent that to your mortgage company. We then followed up and spoke with Cynthia @ the mortgage company and she advised payment was sent to the carrier on 5/6/17 and to allow 7-10 days to arrive. Payment was posted on 5/16/17. Again, had the mortgage company not given us the wrong information, this would have been avoided. I'm glad that my service team was able to go the extra mile to make sure you were taken care of.I truly wish you the best!"
"This is not an accurate representation of the facts. First, Dimitri didn't write this auto policy for you. It was written by a former agent of Brightway and an acquaintance of yours. Dimitri fielded a phone call from you and reviewed the policy on the carrier website and pulled the original application, signed by you, to make certain the policy on the carrier website was the same as the contract that you and the former agent agreed to. You indicated that you wanted to add coverage's to the policy, this was processed immediately, per your request. Dimitri indicated your new annual increase in premium. Had you requested a policy re-quote with a different carrier, we would have provided you with one--had you requested a cancellation, a form would have been provided immediately for your signature, however, none of these were requested. At Brightway Insurance, we go to great lengths to make certain all of our clients needs are met with honesty and integrity."
Thank you for your feedback. We always strive to make everyone's visit as pleasant and friendly as possible.

"Brittany,Thank you for your feedback. We truly apologize for the inconvenience you experienced. Typically new patients experience minimal wait times which are usually just enough time to complete your initial paperwork. We are sorry to hear that you experienced a longer wait time than expected. As a convenient, walk-in clinic, it can be difficult to predict wait times, though we do our best to establish proper expectations when you come in. Unfortunately, there are popular times when peak wait times may occur. Our goal is to give convenient and quality care to every patient who walks through the door.  We would appreciate the opportunity to properly address your experience and make this right. You may be glad to know that follow up visits usually only take 5-10 minutes to get you back on track to chiropractic health and on your way to the rest of your day. Please, email or call us to confirm the best way for management to contact you.Best in Health,The Joint Chiropractic"

"All our price’s are detailed and published online on our website since 2012. We are the only audio video professionals that display all our prices for complete transparency. Our prices are very reasonable, justified by lots of reviews. We provide the best white glove service in Toronto. For unlisted service prices, we need a customers full acceptance before proceeding with a job. We commence work once you are fully excited to work with us.Our aim is to earn your good review for doing a perfect job. Starting from your first interaction till the completion of the job, our goal is to delight our customers so that they will introduce us to their family and friends without even asking for a referral. Obviously this was not the case for you and we are ashamed for it. We hate for our customer to think they overpaid for the value we bring. We do have to agree that the two weeks before the COVID-19 lockdown surfaced, we restricted the number of technicians that can be allowed into a home for the safety of our customers and technicians. Doing this did not safe us any money as you may think. In fact the opposite happen, to ensure that all of our existing customers were serviced before the official lockdown we had incurred extra costs. We got our senior technicians and backend management staff onto trucks to help complete the backlog. We respect your position and we are really sorry that you felt that you paid more for the excellent service we provide. As for all the other prospect customers who read this review, please note that our pricing is transparent, service level unbeatable. Our support relentless. Call us and email us or go to our website today and learn more about our services. The quick response over email, phone and the attention to detail that we provide to each of you will blow your mind."
"Ashley, thank you for taking time to leave us feedback.  A radiographic exam and a clinical exam (actually looking at the teeth) are required for a proper diagnosis, this is standard of care.  We take time to do a compete set of xrays, intra-oral photos and do a compete exam and oral cancer screening to make sure we are providing our patients the proper treatment plan. Like I mentioned at your visit, I am more than happy to provide you your xrays and intra-oral photos so you can seek a second opinion and/or treatment at another office."
"George, we are sad to hear you are changing offices.  Unfortunately, the insurance company you signed up for sets the rules and fees for procedures.  It's not up to our office to decide on payments and amounts.  We do our best to bill and collect from insurance companies to minimize our patient's out of pocket cost.  There is no guarantee of payment ever from insurance companies.  We hope you will take this into consideration and stay with our practice!"

You let me be creative and it turned out wonderful. Thank you again for allowing my vision to come to light. Hope you enjoy your new renovation for years to come!
I contacted you several times regarding the rep no longer being with us. Several emails w explanations were not enough. It was was obvious that not getting  serviced after apologies and explainations were not enough and people automatically turn to Yelp for their frustrations. This is ridiculous for small business owners to go thru this w people that are not even our clients. I did my best to explain and apologize... what more can I explain to you Sr.
Thank you so much for your business. It was so awesome working with you both. My crew always mentioned how kind and thoughtful you were. They were so happy to work in your project and the treatment they received daily. That makes their job so pleasant and motivates them even more. I appreciate clients so much for that. I enjoyed it and my Project Manager and Crew. Thank you again for everything... really I do appreciate your kindness and your business.

We are a detail oriented team therefore the end results shows.  We look forward to your backyard renovation.
Thank you so much Miss Latonya for your review. We truly appreciate you and look forward to serving you again in the future! Enjoy your hair you looked truly amazing when you left the salon!
"Thank you so much for your faux review!Please beware, the account of events in review are false.This review was left by a person who came into our salon during a pandemic, utilized our salon, our products and services. She later thanked our stylist and even gave her a $30 tip and never complained once during her service.If I had a horrible experience, or if I was unsatisfied with a service I personally would have made mention ofit to my stylist. Angela, never mentioned beinguncomfortable even when asked by stylist on multiple occasions. If I was unhappy with how my hair was being treated, I also wouldn’t have left a $30 tip. But Angela left a $30 tip and thanked her stylist before leaving.Just doesn’t make sense.Angela also let us know she is a formerly licensed cosmetologist from Seattle now here in the Las Vegas area unable to work due to issues with her license.The following day Angela reports her service to her credit card as an unauthorized transaction. A scam and crime against a small business. This is a fake review, from a competitor who cameto our salon and literally stole product and services."
"Attention: This is a fake review about a non-issue and a fabrication. From a person who admittedly states they have never used our services. The last review most likely got removed, because it was fake too.As you KNOW, we specialize in Diva Maintenance and BaddieCreation, good luck with your hair journey.10/17/2020Previous reviewLast review got deleted,  cant believe how this company went back and forth with me regarding an in salon appointment they never gave me the address for, kept saying they emailed it to me but could never produce the email confirmation?? I said i will cancel because i need an address instead of being nice.. they responded okay your cancelled!!! horrible customer service, was sending laughing faces to me telling me off and all.., i kept the text messages with them laughing and picking with me so my bank refunded the 25 deposit they charged me after i showed them the messages"
"I am so sorry you were upset by that phone call. We truly wish we could have helped you on your hair journey, but our only interaction is one over the phone, we have never done your hair.We have never portrayed ourselves as a stand alone salon, we are a sew-in weave service located, inside of a larger salon. Our stylist are licensed by the State Board of Cosmetology and we have access to our location 24/7. Our location includes a private suite in which our clients are privately serviced. From my understanding we really tried to help you when you called. It was after hours but we still tried to help. You explained you were having trouble booking your appointment and needed assistance, so we helped you out by attempting to walking you through the booking process... It wasn't until you specifically stated that you would not pay a deposit for the  bundles wanted to purchase or appointment you wanted to book, is when you became upset.All of our clients pay a deposit, it is a policy.You requested next day service and to purchase 4 bundles of 28""-30"" hair, you also requested to have the unpurchased bundles of 28""-30"" hair pre-dyed for your next day appointment a light grey to dark grey ombré and then you wanted all 4 bundles installed in a vixen sew-in...All of these services were requested but you continued to state you did not want to pay a deposit... This behavior is typical of someone who is not a serious client, but someone who’s a competitor looking to create false reviews.We never quoted you a price, but in your review you mention a $400 price, this price did not come from our business. That is just not true.We wish you luck on your hair journey!"

We were in and out within 30 minutes if that. The service was great and the doctors were helpful. Turns out my kid just had a viral infection and just needed to wait it out. I liked that there was an emergency room for just children. It made me feel at ease since we were only on Las Vegas for vacation.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationScott K.Business Employee4/30/2019Thanks for the review! We're happy to hear about your positive experience.
"PICU doctor Benari says we are ready to go home. We disagree. Our child is still struggling to breathe, she's not sleeping at all and is having a hard time getting rid of secretions. We request that another x-ray be done. This morning Dr Sterrett says the x-rays came back and the lungs are clear. Pneumonia is all gone. We are excited and he also says they're going to move us to peds unit until she is able to sleep without oxygen. Which is what we had been fighting for. Later in the afternoon Doctor Martinez comes by says Hey I'm gonna be your doctor on the other side and we just got lab results back that show food particles in the lungs. (So we were going to be released without all lab results being back) let's do more tests while you're with us. Ok. Next Dr. Galves comes by and says he's going to be part of the team treating my child on the peds side. Says we need to get her back on antibiotics because her x-rays from this morning are showing that she still has pneumonia. What? But we were told that those same x-rays came back clean. I am so incredibly dissatisfied with the aftercare my child received from the DOCTORS in the PICU I want to reiterate that 90% of the nurses and RT staff here are amazing and great but the PHYSICIANS need to stop trying to send sick kids home.See all photos from Jackie V. for UMC Children's HospitalUseful 8Funny 1Cool 2Business owner informationScott K.Business Employee4/23/2018We take patient feedback seriously, and would like to learn more about your experience. We encourage you to contact our team at 702-383-2376 or feedback@umcsn.com.4/18/2018Previous reviewPediatric Hospital:We brought my daughter here due to complications from pneumonia. Limited by insurance, our only options were here or a hospital in Summerlin and we emphatically chose here. We were 1st admitted on the Pediatric side for 3 days and sent home with continuing antibiotics. The majority of the staff there was really friendly and nice with the exception of a resident doctor who didn't let you finish answering her question before asking another. She seemed to be rushed and lacked bedside manner. PICU:After being home for a full day, my daughter took a turn and we had to call 911 due to her not breathing. (She has Cerebral Palsy as an underlying condition) She was transported to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. We have been here for 5 days now and I must say we have received nothing but the best care! All the nurses are amazing and the doctors as well. We especially love Dr. Judith Ben Ari Lazcano. She is so kind, charasmatic and speaks to our daughter, not about her. They are not in any hurry to get her out of here either. Children's Hospital:According to the hospital website, there's a family retreat room here for parents to be able to recharge. We have never been told about it and when I asked, the nurses do not know anything about it. Parental support is lacking. Especially for the parents who are here not wanting to leave their child. It would be nice if they offered a room with a shower, fridge, microwave, water cooler, where a parent could go to recharge, store food, freshen up change clothes etc. without having to leave. Child life program:  Our experience with Child Life has been almost non existent. When she was admitted the 1st time, a child life specialist came to triage and told her that someone in her unit would be coming by to bring her movies, games etc etc etc. No one ever came. We asked for her 2 days and still nothing. She was too busy we were told. Ok why get a child all excited with promises of fun and games and then not follow through. How frustrating. The second stay was the same. Someone showed up on day 1, promising fun, games and movies but again, 5 days and nothing."

" I thought the location wasn't ideal but this is a decent place nice office personal they even give you the use of there truck for your move in as long as you return by 5pm they do close the gate by 7pm so it isn't 24 hour facility to use but that's great cause there might be theft going on security cameras are onsite and management actually resides on the premises not telling where lol you can buy there locks or bring yr own and they want you to buy there insurance  the prices are very reasonable and they give you 1st month free but a service charge of 17 plus the insurance so it equates to 29 dollar move in this one is located close to the strip I totally recommendUsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationSonny N.Business Customer Service4/1/2021Hi Lexie,We appreciate your feedback!

".. They are charging me the same rate as a new customer. Looking to either sell or find  another place. They keep the place very clean and nice employees. The reply   I received was of no benefit..I have already discussed this with the office number you gave me....Almost a 20.00 increase. I,could see a few extra dollars.  But not that much of a increase.. Zero for 1st month rental...That did not apply to me when I first rented.This is a corporate issue..As I was told..Calling corporate leaving  a message.. Then send me right back to the Manager.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationSonny N.Business Customer Service6/26/2019Hi Mary,We're sorry to hear about your frustration with the rate change. Rental increases are a customary part of the storage industry as a whole, and they are issued in order to offset facility maintenance expenses and rising property costs. It appears you've spoken with our District Manager in regards to this concern. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the office to discuss at 602-840-0581. We hope you reconsider leaving us, as we pride ourselves on providing great service and a clean, safe place to store your belongings. Thank you for sharing!Kind Regards,Management"
"Hi Amber, would it be possible to contact me at 514-766-2138, as I noticed you ordered again yesterday and there was a misunderstanding with your invoice (debit). Thank you ** since you did not call me today but decided to lower your star rating instead with an update, let me just explain that the 4$ service charge was charged by the delivery service company who delivered your order and not us as we do not accept debit cards, instead we provide this service to our customers and its up to the customer to decide if she/he will take it. Again, I apologize if there was a misunderstanding and sorry to hear that you were once again not happy with our services.10/3/2017Previous reviewAfter our second order I noticed that the food wasn't great at all. Meat was weird, pita wasn't tastey the fries and everything were made with no love. Didn't even end up eating my wrap it tasted so awful.Not a fan anymore9/13/2017Previous reviewNever heard of this place before and I've lived in this area a little bit. I had the club sandwich which was good chicken wasn't that weird creepy meat you get from your local pizza joint. Fries were thick cut and a nice change from the usual French fries. I Tasted the hamburger and cheese as well and I was pretty surprised, they didn't throw in a whole slice of onion the size of the patty which was a nice change. The gyro was good and the souvlaki was great apparently I didn't try either of them but I believe what my friend said. I would order from here again for sure"
"Thank you so much for your review and giving Beauty Kouture the perfect opportunity to discuss our cancellation policy! Thankfully this review is not based upon the quality of our services but rather one of our policies. In order to avoid any miscommunications or confusions about our industry standard cancellation policy, it is posted publicly on all social media sites, our website and our online scheduling system site. Our spa policies are also included in the multiple emails sent prior to scheduled appointments at Beauty Kouture. Furthermore it is discussed thoroughly over the phone before first time client appointments are scheduled. Following this discussion we collect the information needed regarding the credit card on file we require in order to schedule appointments due to this cancellation policy. Cancellation policies serve a phenomenal purpose and ultimately can strengthen the 'Client-Beauty Kouture' relationship. Scheduled appointments are very important to Beauty Kouture and the team members of Beauty Kouture, as they are reserved specifically for the individual and service requested. We understand that sometimes schedule adjustments are necessary; therefore, we respectfully request at least 24 hours notice for cancellations.Understandably that when clients forget, cancel or show up late to scheduled appointment without giving enough notice, we miss the opportunity to fill that appointment time, and clients on our waiting list miss the opportunity to receive services. Although it is the clients responsibility to remember appointment dates and times to avoid late arrivals, missed appointments and the cancellation fee as a courtesy, our appointments are confirmed 48 hours in advance because we know how easy it is to forget an appointment that was booked in advance. In addition to the 48 hour in advance confirmation, we also send a reminder 25 hours in advance, thus giving another opportunity to cancel within our cancellation policy and avoiding fees. As the services are reserved for the individual personally, a cancellation fee will apply.  Less than 24 hour notice will result in a charge to the card on file equal to 50% of the reserved service amount.""No shows"" will be charged to the card on file 100% of the reserved service amount.  Late arrivals are considered a no show due to the result of the professional not having ample amount of time to complete the scheduled service with the upmost quality in mind. The cancellation policy allows us the time to inform our standby guests on our waiting list of any availability, as well as keeping our Beauty Kouture team members schedules filled in which their financial livelihood depends upon, thus better serving everyone. All of our policies are presented and provided in multiple sources with the intention of excellent servicing for our established and future clientele. Again, thank you for allowing Beauty Kouture the perfect opportunity to discuss our policies and providing an additional source where our future clients can view our policies."

" Nissan Altima. I should have seen the red flags but I like to believe there are honest people. We ended up buying the car for $10,500 on Monday Nov 6th, came back to Tucson took it to my mechanic where a bunch of codes came up I called them back on Wednesday and they say car is as is. My mechanic shows me so many issues that I feel the dealership should look at it we take it to the dealership Friday morning. They call us the same afternoon and say they don't recommend driving the car, the frame is bent, the codes that come up are longer than his arm and there are NO AIRBAGS. They say the condition of the car should be a salvage title which as mention before the car was advertised as a clean title. I've reached out to them again today via text to Work this out with them. The car is unsafe to drive so I'm left with a car I paid $10,500 for with no use to me. I wouldn't even give a star. I was lied to and taken advantage by these people who claim to be honest that he doesn't like to lie to people. They sold me a car with a salvage title without disclosing this to me. I've reached out twice today with no response. RUN ALL VIN #'s THROUGH  NICB.ORG. Apparently it takes some time for salvage titles to be recognized in other states this website is free and will give you the honest information on the vin so you don't get scammed.Useful 3FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationMaria D.Business Owner12/27/2017Hello Cynthia, We have contacted you privately about this matter and have not received a response.

"Dr. Nikogosian was running 20 minutes late and we called you more than one hour prior to your appointment time to inform you of this. That does not excuse being late and for that we again apologize for any inconvenience.  Prompt appointment times are always our goal but due to the nature of dealing with chronically ill adults and children, unforeseen events do arise from time to time. We’ve found that most of our patients are understanding of this when it does occur on occasion. We called ahead before your appointment to inform you as a courtesy.

"Ma'am your anger is not being directed at the right company..if it took 3 weeks for you to get your fridge repaired it is because YOUR insurance company took their time in sending us the parts...believe me, we don't get paid unless your appliance gets fixed, so the last thing we want to do is hold onto a repair longer than necessary."
"With all due respect sir, your parts were ordered by your warranty company and not us at Hawkeye Appliance Repair...our COD customers are serviced same or next day and parts are installed just as quickly because we are able to get the parts directly from the parts house.I assure you that your case was very rare for our company but appreciate your time in writing this review!"

Third, I find it very very strange you had the SAME complaint under another company about a custom birthday. Seems like you make up fictitious reviews! I truly think Yelp should flag this review as it is obvious this customer likes to make up fictitious reviews, not just for us but for the other company that has also been a victim. (You can view her other negative review by clicking her link. It is very hard to believe she's had the same identical complaint with two different companies that specializes in custom birthday parties.)Bake Me a Cake has had over 300+ birthdays with NO complaints.. ever!

This place had great reviews so I tried one more time and was told by a man I could come in before 12 pretty much any day and that there would be a woman or the owner there to take my measurements! I went in and it's a cute little family owned shop. Thankfully I wasn't charged a full price alter since the job was so small! I paid less than $10 and the bottom were perfect!

We only have one person at a time in the store everybody else waits outside and we have a 6 foot distancing and have move the cash register to accommodate this distancing. We offer hand sanitizing and offer a touchless payment option. We also have a dropbox and a drive-through and plenty of space to social distance which is our requirement. It is about 130° in there during the day due to no air-conditioning because of all the steam required to do our job. We would pass out if we had to wear facemasks in this type of establishment.
Thank you Richard!
"I called ahead to make sure they had the bike tube sizes I needed and the gentleman who answered was happy to help me. He let me know he had the sizes and even had them waiting for me when I arrived to purchase them, he remembered the phone call and all I had to say was that I called in about the tubes and he named the sizes like we had just spoken (we didn't go for a few hours after I called so I was impressed by this). Upon arrival we looked at all the bikes and accessories while he got us all squared away. I asked him a few questions about bike maintenance and how I was interested in learning the basics so I can do the easy things to fix on my own and he informed me that every Wednesday they do a free class which goes over all the maintenance I was interested in doing on my own. How freaking cool is that?!  Their equipment is legit and they offer much more than just bikes and accessories etc. their service is phenomenal and I will absolutely come back here for all my bicycle needs.Useful 7Funny 1Cool 9Business owner informationDennis L.Business Owner1/19/2021Thanks!!"

"So happy that my neighborhood bakery has gotten new owners. At first, I doubted the authenticity of a Korean-French fusion bakery. I was so very wrong. This store has improved ten-fold. As hard as I try not to, I always end up stopping by for their tasty slices of cake. The lychee one is delicious! Subtle & sweet. I also stock up on croissants, which are even better- mainly their almond croissant! They have a great variety- coconut, pumpkin, chocolate & almond, or plain butter. I have yet to try their lunch/sandwich offerings but I cannot wait to do so.9/23/18 update: called their phone number, apparently currently closed for renovationsDelicious almond croissantUseful 17Funny 5Cool 15Business owner informationKristin F.Business Owner3/29/2018Dearest Vivian, what can I say more than I advisory absolutely agree with you Bonjour almond croissant are DELICIOUS and we are so proud of it.

"Thank you for providing your feedback, Gabbriella G. We think the groupon we had was a great deal. Our regular eye exam is $125 and you would have saved $50. We're sorry if you didn't feel the same and we hoped you would at least give us the opportunity to show you the quality services we provide before making this review. We set a high standard for ourselves and are truly sorry to hear that standard was not met in your interaction with us. We're all about positivity and if you believe in that, we'd be happy to help you.P.S. We received the exact same review from Rachael Russell on Google. Are you the same person? This does not sound genuine and we're not sure what your intentions are, however, we hope to work out any concerns. Best Regards,Kodak Lens | Toronto Eyecare"
":I do not see the truth behind your brand being ""all about positivity"" when the basis of this issue stems from me being spoken to incredibly rudely at your store. I don't appreciate the duality of treatment in person and on the internet - because it seems that customer service only matters when the truth is being posted for everyone to see. I also don't think an additional discount will rectify the unnecessary attitude and waste of time I was awarded when waiting for my appointment. UPDATE:My response to the company:It's great to hear that you set a high standard for your staff - but the fact that I was spoken to rudely from the moment I stepped into the store, I find to be incredibly alarming. Particularly given that the norm for eye exams is that contacts are to be replaced upon taking them out, and if not, for a contact lens containers to be provided - rather than have the customer all but request to use one. I also need not be squeezed for money and be told that I would have to pay an additional fee for a contact lens prescription. Additionally, if an appointment is made, then an appointment is to be kept - rather than change the ""assumed length of an appointment"" from 30 minutes to an hour, given that the optometrist themselves were running late. I shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes then be asked if there was somewhere I needed to be...All I could think about as I was storming out was that there was no way on earth that I was going to keep my appointment and PAY this lady to be rude to me. I am never one to cause a scene, but god I could not believe this woman was speaking this way to me.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationTaylor C.Business Customer Service10/24/2019Update for Yelp viewers: Based on the direct messaging conversation from July, we continued to apologize for the experience and tried to offer a solution, but unfortunately unable to work with individual to create an overall positive experience moving forward.

"Good Afternoon Becki.As this is the only communication or feedback that you have given us since your visit, I have not had the opportunity to talk to you about your concerns.  I am very sorry that your experience with us did not meet your expectations.  I have reviewed the audio and video recording of your interaction with the doctor and technician during the examination that day.  The video simply does not support your claims.  Your pet had a potentially serious injury, the doctor provided her exam findings and described to you the possible outcomes which you refer to as, ""scare tactics"".  The doctor did want your pet to be seen again in 3-5 days due to swelling and other irritation in the area of the injury. That way she could provide a more accurate assessment of the injured area.  She also prescribed medications for your cat's pain and possible infection.  This was done with your cat's health as the top priority, not to ""to get more money"" as you say.During the interaction with the doctor and our technician you were actively asking questions about the injury itself and at home care.  The doctor answered all of your questions and you seemed to be having a very cordial back and forth conversation.  Both the doctor and technician ended their interactions with you by asking you if you had any questions about anything.  I am sorry that you feel that your, ""opinion/input was disregarded entirely.""  The video recording did not substantiate your description of our staff's behavior.  I am not certain what would motivate you to post this review and cite things that just didn't happen, but I hope that you are able to find a veterinarian that will better meet your expectations in the future.Mike BVeterinary Practice ManagerHealthy Pet Veterinary Clinic"

"Stephanie we wish you had more fat too!! You've been such a kind, positive, and kick butt client! Thank you for the kind words- we are so happy with your outcome and proud of you for making some changes too- YOU made your results even better! Don't be a stranger we love ya!!! Taking the time to write this means a great deal to us- thank you!!!"
"Hey Kim,Thank you for coming in and sitting down with my sister and I. We are truly bummed that you don't see what we see and are not happy with your results, they are absolutely what we would anticipate and we do our very best to set proper expectations during a consult.Thanks for posting the photos- I have added some in our photo library as well since I can't post them here:(You only posted one set and unless people click on it they can't see the full transformation, you also only posted a single angle which isn't a full representation of what we achieved for you, I had sent you a sets of 6 different photos. I want to address some of your comments. You and I have talked at length, but it's key for anyone reading this review to have the full picture. Your bra line does look different, and you are also wearing a different bra. We've taken 10s of thousands of photos and when someone wears a different bra, or underwear, etc, the fat can look different. We treated your abdomen and that is why we had you wear the same shorts each time, to minimize any potential optical illusions or distortions as demonstrated with your different bras. We are thrilled you started a cardio program and hope you keep it up. We do monitor weight. You did your initial treatment in Feb of this year and from then until your last follow up, you were down 2 pounds, so the changes you saw were not due to weight loss. We also have noted from our consults (it's key for us to document all conversations) that part of the reason you came to inquire about CoolSculpting was that no matter what you do, your stomach doesn't change, even if you lose weight.  During your consult, as with all consults, we showed you dozens of our own clients who looked like you and did the same plan we mapped out for you. At that time, you felt the $4,800 was in line with that type of results we showed you of our past clients and you opted to move forward.We have done 22,000 treatments and feel you got what we'd anticipate. As discussed, during your follow up, we wanted to ensure we were not overstating your results, so we sent your photos to CoolSculpting. They, as I let you know, asked to use your photos in their national campaign (thank you for signing the paperwork that indicates we can use your photos internally and for marketing purposes). This was an additional layer of acknowledgement for us, that we did achieve what we'd anticipate after two rounds of CoolSculpting. We have retreated 189 people for free at Bodify, so our integrity and Beautiful Results Promise is real and valid and hopefully by looking at the vast majority of our reviews, you'll see our clients feel the same. Those individuals we treated for free were done some because they did not see the anticipated changes in their body as promised, in your case, we feel we delivered on our promise after two rounds of treatments.Of course we don't love that you are not happy and that is why we offered a middle ground solution for you to simply cover the cost of the actual treatment so you could do another round. I wish you felt differently about that offer and if your mind ever changes, we'd love to have you back as you are GREAT responder to CoolSculpting.8/24/2020Previous reviewDisappointed so far. I had my first session six months ago, my second session 3 months ago. I was a size 10 and am still. No change at all in clothing size. Based on their photos, I estimate I've only lost 1/4 inch of fat. Horrible value for the money spent. I have an appointment to go back in 3 weeks and I hope they will extend their beautiful results promise since I'm not seeing results we discussed. I'll update my review at that time."
"Hi StacyWe of course take every single review we get seriously. You are a great candidate for CoolSculpting, your last follow up was over a year ago and you mentioned you had ""overindulged more than typical during the summer""-lol like many of us- and that is why you were up in weight. At your follow up we had suggested our doors are always open for you to return when you are back down in weight.You had won some CoolSculpting and invested in an additional area- thank you!We do love CoolSculpting, however it is not a magic bullet and if our clients don't maintain their weight then they can easily stop appreciating their results.Our beautiful promise treats those individuals who stayed the same weight and did not see a change with CoolSculpting. We are always happy to have you back in for more photos when you are back at your original weight please feel free to call, text, email, or self book when you'd like to come in:)Please also remember CoolSculpting removes 20% of the fat in the area, so often when clients want a more dramatic reduction they get to do two rounds not one of CoolSculpting.Let me know if you have other questions.I also called and left you a message and my personal cell phone, I look forward to hearing from you"
"Hey Scott,Thanks for being open and honest about liking the staff. I'm sorry you didn't feel the second round gave you what you wanted. We did try to call you once in June, twice in July and once in August to get you back in for a follow up and we never heard back. CoolSculpting takes 2-4 months to see full results and if, for some reason, we don't see an additional 20-25% reduction after your second treatment, our policy is to retreat you for free!However, if you don't come in for follow up appointments we have no way to know.You've experienced us after the first round and follow ups and you know we are honest and stand by our work so I urge you to call, set up the 3 follow up appointments that were never booked and let us make it right if CoolSculpting didn't do it's job. I look forward to hearing from you. 602-354-8040UPDATE:Scott thank you for responding. I sent you a private message as well. Unfortunately much of what you said is not accurate. We do not show before and after photos of those who have lost weight, as that would be misleading. Most who do CoolSculpting don't radically change diet or exercise after. The come to us, because they do mostly the right things, yet certain areas of the body don't budge. 90% of those who come to us are not on a weight loss journey, they are at a healthy weight, eat pretty well and exercise, they simply want the remaining pockets to shift!CoolSculpting will remove 20-25% of the fat in the area we treat, if you have lost weight on your own the results will be more dramatic. You've lost 20 pounds, you rock, and you are correct at this stage we would not be able to tell if your change was a result of your efforts only or a combination of your efforts and CoolSculpting. I wish we could. Regardless, you've lost weight and feel better in your skin so we are happy for you.CoolSculpting reduces volume, it doesn't make people lose weight, we are very certain to ensure our clients know this.Every applicator we use is FDA-cleared and will reduce tissue by 20-25%. The applicators we elect to use are 100% dependent on how your tissue sits, how much you have and if it is tight or can be pulled up easily. The majority of applicators are suction based, we used the flat, the coolsmooth pro applicator on you initially as your tissue was thick and didn't pinch well. The 2nd round, because it reduced in volume, we were able to use the suction applicator. People are hard on themselves, and I can say first hand we have clients come in at the 4 month mark and are not positive the treatment worked, we snap the photos, line them up and show they client and they  have the ""oh my gosh it did work"" moment. The change is slow and gradual so that can throw people off. That is why we urge people to come in to do photos and have our beautiful results promise. We do business right:)We've done 12,000 treatments, our promise is to retreat anyone who did not see at least a 20% reduction of the tissue in the area treated. Do date, 10.23.2017 we have retreated 54 people. Of those 54, 11 still saw no reduction, darn non-responders. I'm sharing this info so you and others who are contemplating CoolSculpting as a solution have accurate info and can make a decision that is best for them. I respect you and I'm sorry you feel the way you do, I really wish you had reached out in June with your frustration so we could have taken photos and done free treatments if necessary. I'm bummed we were not given an opportunity to make it right. I sincerely care about you and your opinions Scott!"

"My sister and I came here on a Monday to find her a new pair of shoes. My sister has special needs and her feet tend to turn inwards when she walks. The shoes she had from the beginning of the school year were worn out and needed to be replaced. Unfortunately, when it comes to shoes, sometimes it can be a bit challenging to find a pair that is supportive enough so she doesn't have to wear the painful orthotic inserts that she's been prescribed.In search of another pair of Asics, we ended up here at Run for Your Life. I called earlier in the day to see if they sold Asics for children and they stated that they did. We showed up about two hours later and we were warmly greeted by Windy. She was extremely attentive to my sister and analyzed her feet and shoes thoroughly as well as her gait and recommended a shoe based on her analysis. A cool pair of New Balances.  When she put them on, the difference was like night and day. Immediately, I noticed that her ankles were upright. When she watched her walk and saw her heels were slipping she altered the laces into a special formation that stopped the slipping. I was impressed to say the least. I called my Mom so she could give her approval. Unable to reach her, I asked Windy if they could be held. She obliged without hesitation and we left. After leaving, my Mom called and said she would head over and that I too should pick out some shoes. After a Starbucks break, we headed back. This time, Lexi analyzed and measured my feet and informed me of what I should be looking for in a shoe. She brought out three options, from 3 brands: Mizuno, New Balances and Adidas. She also let me demo a special pair of socks to try on too. The two together made all of the difference. I noticed a huge difference immediately, even with the shoes I ended up liking the least. I tried on each pair and Lexi watched me walk in each and agreed that the Adidas appeared to be the best option.  We purchased both pair and bought the socks on a buy 3 get one free special. My sister ended up wearing her shoes out of the store and donating her others to their Samaritan's Feet donation collection. I later returned mine after finding a deal at a bulk retailer that they simply couldn't afford to match as a small retailer which I understood completely. Even still that doesn't negate the outstanding experience we had. We will continue to patronize them, especially for my sister's footwear needs. One thing I found really cool is that they offer more than shoes and apparel. They also offer workshops, classes, training, races and fittings. Really a well-rounded business. I really enjoyed my visit and would recommend then highly for running shoe needs.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationBrian M.Business Manager8/8/2018Brittanie,Thanks so much for allowing us to meet your amazing family! Windy and Lexi both had so much fun with you and can't wait for the next visit!"
"I am not a runner. I do not know much about shoes or anything of that nature. But I was looking for a particular pair of shoes and after going to Northlake Mall and visiting each shoe store and unable to find what I was looking for - I called Run For Your Life and they had a pair of Asics Gel Nimbus and in my size. They were actually closing soon but the guy told me they would wait for me if I was coming. Honestly, I was hesitant. Why would wait for me if they were closing but I took the chance and headed that way. They waited. And I was greeted with the most wonderful experience ever. He asked me why I was looking for the shoes and what I would be using them for. I told him I was going to be doing copious amounts of walking and needed something that would provide a lot of support. Call this crazy but he actually sold me shoes that were cheaper (much) than I had asked for. He said there is more to a shoe than just the shoe. He took into consideration how I walked, the arch of my foot, my ankles, my knees and so much more. I was a little taken back because when we went to put on shoes, they actually went to the put the shoes on my feet for me. I was like wait, what?! This is a thing? Mind blown. And the socks they had me put on with the tennis shoes (I was wearing no show dress socks) were amazing. I never in my life knew  a sock could feel so good on your feet. I bough 4 pairs that day. The staff here is amazing. They are well versed in the shoes and getting the right fit for you. But they know what they are doing by selling you the right shoe - even if it is a cheaper option. I came back and spent more money. We ended up coming back to get some walking flip flops that were $50-$60 each and they are amazing. It is like walking on clouds. I love flips flops but let's face it - they are not so great for your feet. But now I have the comfort and support I actually need. They have a new life long customer in me. Any time we need any type of ""tennis shoe"" we will be coming here.Useful 6Funny 2Cool 4Business owner informationBrian M.Business Manager8/8/2018Debra,We're excited to have you as a life long customer!

"I'm trying to be a more diligent runner, but my left foot has been giving me issues.  Is it my shoes, the socks, the way I run?  Thankfully Beth at Run For Your Life is there to help!She listened patiently while I told her my issue, she watched me walk, did a running test on the treadmill, analyzed it with me, discussed possible other shoe offerings, advised me on socks, & ""Body Glide"". I was very pleased with the level of attention I received.They also have a rewards program...spend $250 in the store (accumulating) & you'll receive a discount on your next purchase.The offerings!

"My 2nd time visiting the Door & Trim Store.I had stopped in several months ago to look over some trim for when we installed our new wood flooring. Everyone was helpful the first time I went in, so I decided to come back. The first time I went in they spent about 20 minutes explaining options, materials, pricing, corner pieces etcI arrived today and was immediately greeted by 2 store employees. I let them know which trim I wanted and the quantity. The prices are much lower than what Home Depot & Lowes want for the same thing. The ordering process was very quick and easy.I needed delivery because the trim pieces were 17ft long. They quoted a delivery charge of $65. This was quite reasonable in my opinion considering I live about 22 miles away, and how quickly they could deliver. The delivery was scheduled for the very next day.The important part for me was due to the pieces being 17ft I won't need to join together as many cuts on my longer walls. Less joining means seamless lengths. I received a phone call the next morning indicating delivery would occur in the next 1/2 hour.The driver arrived and unloaded the trim. I noticed several pieces were damaged and noted it on the delivery signature sheet. The driver indicated to call the office and they would assist me.By the time I got a chance to call them they were calling me to have some pictures sent over so they could evaluate the damage. They let me know a few minutes later they would replace the pieces and bring them by that afternoon.The replacement pieces were dropped off as indicated.Overall a very good experience with them, and very satisfied with their resolution so quickly on damaged pieces. I will use them again if we replace out more.The store had a few cases of trim examples, quite a few doors to choose from, and accessories. Everyone was friendly.See all photos from David S. for The Door & Trim StoreUsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationArmando O.Business Owner2/5/2020David, wow!  Thank you so much for this awesome 5-star review.  We really appreciate you choosing us and helping to share the word about us.

Be prepared to get yelled at over the phone when you ask for an exchange and to have your words twisted by all these people and FALSE POLICIES to not get your money back.

And oh and be prepared when you go pick up and exchange to not even have the right mattress you asked for so you can argue with the salesman again. They do not care about their customers because if they did they wouldn't have treated me so bad and made me waste my time picking up a mattress that I AGAIN did not request for.

", we currently have the highest infection and death rate  in the country, masks are required to be worn if inside a gym. I was obviously concerned by this,  particularly when one of the girls that wasn't wearing a mask was coughing so I left before my workout was complete. I called the owner, Wade, the next morning and explained my concerns and his response was ""You really think masks work?""  As a matter of fact, I do, considering I go to Arizona State University and have gained extensive knowledge in the field of human diseases and transmission by my great professor who is also an epidemiologist. Regardless, non-enforcement of masks violates the state's mask mandate and that's the exact reason I both cancelled my membership and reported the gym to the Arizona Department of Health Services. It seems that non-enforcement is a common issue in smaller gyms and I am happy to have signed up as a member at Lifetime Fitness who followers CDC guidance and the mandate outlined by AZ DHS.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationGlendale AZ A.Business Owner1/27/2021We clean our gym top to bottom daily.

It's a peaceful, loving, friendly environment.

"Thanks for your feedback. The idea that some people are more hypnotizable than others is supported by the scientific literature, and in our experience, we've found that a quick suggestibility test (which you would have experienced during your consultation) is a reliable indicator of how well hypnosis is likely to work for any particular client.Our philosophy is that it's better to be disappointed during a free consultation than to be disappointed five sessions down the road. So, we will continue to use suggestibility testing to assess new clients. Please don't feel singled out, though. In about 20% of our consultations, we recommend against proceeding with hypnosis, for various reasons."

"Dear Veronica, Please accept my sincere apology.  We never permit anyone to return a phone call  who does not know exactly what we have to offer so I'm not sure who might have returned your message. All of our services and pricing are clearly displayed on our website so that should not have been an issue. Again, I sincerely apologize. These are the 4 specific reasons why I chose to eliminate our Secretary in 2008: #1: Because of our Same Prices Since 1998 and Full 60-Minute and Full 90-Minute appointments, instead of 50-Minute and 80-Minute appointments that are offered by the major majority of other Day Spas and Massage organizations, we can not afford to pay a Secretary too. #2: I always try to do everything possible to eliminate any  un-needed, un-necessary and un-wanted noise @ both Day Spa so the majority of our return telephone calls are done from an off-site location by myself, my assistant and/or 1 of our 2 daughters. #3: When we did have a Secretary I had to spend and incredible amount of time asking her to STOP talking (making noise) with our Therapists and instead to please focus on her work.  #4. Thankfully, we now have a terrific online appointment scheduling service that's extremely user friendly. Sure, I dearly wish we would have invested in an online appointment scheduling service earlier but that's that 20/20 hindsight thing which I do still regret today. Hopefully, you'll reconsider providing us another opportunity so serve you. Sincerely, Russell  On-Line Scheduling @ thehealingartsdayspa.vir…"
"I'm not much of a Yelp! user so it's taken me some time to figure out how to respond to those who post reviews. Sorry for the delay. I explained to Robyn that my wife, Terrell Lynn, did remember the day of her appointment, it was a very busy Mother's Day weekend, and she also recalled 1 of our Client's treatments being interrupted several times. In our 13+ year history this is not a first for us but happens only very rarely even though we do not hang gaudy signs on our treatment doors, THERAPIST IN SESSION. Instead, we prefer an elegant/clean look and all Clients are personally escorted to their treatment rooms. Because of our Same Prices Since 1998 (13+ years) we no longer have a full time Secretary; so: all of our Therapists do their very best to keep me informed of any customer service issue that requires my attention. I offered to make amends but Robyn refused.  Although we are not perfect we are also not Corporate; so: we can make changes. My door is always OPEN to receive your suggestions and recommendations.

"To Whom this may concern : Dear JAIME , It not a law to wear a mask in any way shape or matter , especially in my own private business. People that wear masks are welcome in our business & its their choice of freedom to do so & the same goes for people that don’t want to wear a mask as well. Not to mention that this a retail business which means I have to talk & explain many things to many customers in a ten hour shift every single day & that requires me to breath normal & have enough oxygen in my body to do so , where as a customer like you is in the shop for only few minutes, so you are not effected by the mask as we would be for 10 hours straight daily. Plus we are all been vaccinated and since people that walk in our business are wearing masks doesn’t that protect them ? So given that explanation it’s not fair for you to tarnish our reputation on the web on a very debatable subject worldwide since yelp is used to talk about businesses customer service, which we know for a fact that our customer service is 15 out 10 . So please JAIME lets keep the ( mask ) issue out of servicing the customer platform grading site !!!!!!!! And I suggest you search how many people die of Diabetes every single day in this country ! That means you & everyone in this great country of ours should boycott & shutdown pepsi & coca cola  for that matter !!!!!!"

"Yes We had to re schedule because another job developed an issue which was unexpected and needed our attention. Had this client been the one in that seat he would have had all the attention any customer could ask for and would have been happy because his stuff was being fixed.Anyway seeing that we could not keep the scheduled appointment and thankfully we didn't have any ties other than a scheduled appointment that was yet to happen. This just has to be clarified because it did not happen like it was stated to have happened. WE DID MAINTAIN CONTACT, AND WE STILL MADE IT OUT TO THE CUSTOMER AND PERFORMED A FACTORY RESET ON THE INVERTER AT NO CHARGE AND WE DID THIS ON THE WEEKEND.So.... We did call, and we did show up, the Reset didn't fix it so they have bigger problems, Im sorry, and seeing they had to leave so soon there wasn't much we could have done beyond that anyway. So we did what we could do at that point and also proceeded to help the 4 other scheduled customers that were also affected by the set back, but thankfully they had a little more understanding.Anyway, I guess this warrants for a 1 star review.Thanks"
"Customer is absolutely right, this is always the case. All I have to say is I called them to see what the problem was. I tried my best to work it out with a man that will outright call me a c*** sucker instead of listen to what I have to say. My intention was to work it out in their favor but the man was too frustrated likely with life in general more than with us considering the times. Anyway. Yes I still refunded them the difference 112$ and change, only charged them for 1.5 hours instead of the 2 it took to ensure everything was adjusted and working flawlessly. It's all to common for people to hear what they want to hear rather than what is said,, an agreement is made over the phone which we keep record of. So maybe it goes to show that they too should write down the details of the agreement at the time of scheduling so they dont forget over the course of 2+ weeks what they agreed to.I encourage them next time to take it to a shop for the same job so they can realize the value a mobile service brings to them."
"I don't want to go into this too much because there is a LOT that went down here. for 1, we charged for work that we did, we were not able to finish the job because all the supplies were not provided to finish the job. 2nd, our Technician showed up early to the job and the technicians at Big O tires where the rig was located allowed our Technician into the vehicle because the Gal had not yet arrived. She Claims she was there for 30 minutes before which I cant even tell you how impossible that would have been, on top of Big O also verifying that we had arrived a half hour before she did. This is Money she is trying to get us to refund which I did offer, and on top of that, I also offered to finish the job Free of charge Which she surely failed to mention Knowing that we did NOT do the job incorrectly when the job simply was not finished.. On top of the Whirlwind of different stories and lies she tried to tell us she eventually got caught up in her lies and it quite frankly was not difficult in any way to notice as she tried to proceed for a full Refund... Mind you,  this all happens after she gets the News that her new truck has a dead cylinder and is going to need to be rebuilt. (Which are the words shared between a Big O tech and Our Tech). This is when It was decided that because we did not owe this gal anything, we exercised our right to cancel any further dealings with this person due to several facts.On top of this, the customer literally trying to pretty much scam us, she also seems to think that her dog grooming service (since it is Mobile), is Just like ours and she thinks that she understands what it takes to run a Mobile RV repair service. When in fact Even after explaining everything about the countless licenses, and renewals and insurances and such that we must maintain Because we work on multi thousand to multi million dollar machines and equipment she still doesn't know what she is talking about and her claims about charging double travel is False. Period.  A service fee helps to pay all licensing and everything else it takes for a company like Happy Hals to be able to provide a service like we do around the many zones of the Las Vegas Area.I could definitely go into more detail but its simply not necessary. We have like many business become more vulnerable to the times. The CoronaVirus has caused us to have to take more upfront measures to ensure that we do not get ripped off as this has become more and more common since. I will simply leave this for you to decide after reading what took place here.Her Comments about the Technician not knowing what he was doing. Please just read the countless Reviews about this Technician an Decide for yourself. His Name is Gordon and He is an excellent technician who takes a lot of pride in his honesty, integrity and especially in his work.Thank you."
"There are never any hidden costs, just people that decide to pay what they think they should pay, or hear what they want to hear instead of what is actually being said. Ask anyone that has worked with us, We tell every customer new or returning how we charge for the convenience we bring to you when you need a repair on your RV, and if you did any research on the company you hired, you would know that if we cannot fix it or do not do what we say we are going to do then we do not charge. Period.This customer was rude and condescending from the get go. Even before scheduling, the customer could barely make up his mind. I Told him we could replace the bent flange easily but he decided to have us come out and try and bend it back into shape, said that the part was way to expensive. I told him we could also do that but it will not be perfect because it is aluminum. He said to come out and do the best we could because he did not want to buy a (What I found out later to be a 70 dollar part). When I arrived our Tech had already done a pretty good job considering how bent this flange was, but the customer had also decided to just replace it. I asked him why he didn't just replace it to begin with? 70 bucks plus two quick cuts and its done and looks bran new. This is when he looks at me  and asks ""do you have 20 bucks? I say yes but not in cash.. then he responds if I asked you for 20 bucks would you give it to me? I responded and said yes, I would rather you ask me for it than try and take it from me.... Then he went on saying a buck is a buck and bla bla bla how every dollar adds up and how expensive it would have been bla bla bla, and all this while he has his garage door wide open showing off his Cherry Red Porche... Anyway, his cherry porche probably has nothing to do with who this guy thinks he is because what we see is yet another customer that has ripped off a company that has come out and done exactly what was understood and agreed upon at scheduling.But since he didn't like how it was looking compared to his cherry porche sitting there, and b4 the tech was even done changed his mind on what he wanted to do and that was that..  I Told the technician to collect the 1 hour minimum, as I was leaving and to not leave the bill open. I could tell this was going to go rotten as soon as I met this guy face to face. I told our technician to tell him we will pro-rate the time not used in the first hour and waive the service fee when we return to install the flange. When the tech was finished the customer disputed the bill just as expected, and told the technician that the owner is a Liar, and that he never told him how we charge or that we charge 3% (Not 6%) for Credit card processing. When the reality is this company holds strict to its policies, and disclosing to every customer how we charge is one of them, weather new or returning. So, Sir we have Many Many Many returning customers who know and appreciate the value we Litterally bring to them with our thorough understanding of how to take care of their investment, and you sir will no longer be able to benefit from that care and understanding, because Happy Hals does not need your business But if ever I see you begging for a buck, I'll give you 20."
"We have tried making contact with this person without success. This person cannot be found anywhere in our system and considering they are not willing to respond to our attempts at making contact, we have to assume that this is not a customer of ours, which invalidates the claims made against us. We have experienced this before with people thinking that they had dealt with us and found out that it was another company that we were being confused with.Thank you."

"Seafood and meat here are great. Unfortunately, the way they run things here during this pandemic times is dangerous. First of all there is limited or no sanitizing station at all. Also I noticed they do not sanitize or clean carts upon each use. Unlike any other stores they clean between each use and sanitizing station everywhere. During this time especialy Covid-19 is spreading fast and vaccine is right around the corner, we should keep in mind still be very careful.

"Thanks for visiting us, Erika, and thanks for taking the time to let us know your opinion.We find that getting our customers' reviews is the very effective way to hear our customers' thoughts. Moreover, customers feel more comfortable to express their opinions through writings, especially, the negative ones. That's why we encourage our customers to take a little time of their busy lives to communicate with us through their reviews. We get the motivation from the positive reviews and the valuable lessons from the negative and constructive ones. There are always new things for us to learn and improve each day.We committed to making our restaurant your ""go to"" poke spot :) The fact that we're in your neighborhood is a great bonus for us :)Thanks again, Erika.Wishing you a great 2018!"
"I went here based off the Yelp! reviews and will say that they were mostly accurate, the food and the bad. This place definitely doesn't have a ""Chain restaurant"" feel, which in this case is both good and bad. Portions were small in my opinion compared to other locations, specifically the salad amount even though I got a large. I was happy with the protein portion, wasn't huge but definitely on par. (I travel for work so am comparing to not only Vegas area but also Phoenix and LA Poke restaurants as well.)Service was not as polished as most chain places either, like Poke Poku. Not unprofessional, just more casual and not polished. More of the the ""just hanging out"" kind of attitude. I didn't mind but I noticed. Also the lack of tea to drink meant I had to pay $2.95 for a bottle of Smart Water - ouch! I don't drink soda so yeah. Adding some standard drip black tea (not powder or instant) would be a big improvement, at least for me.The Yelp! cash back, Check-In discount, location and seemingly honest reviews are what brought me in, and they were all spot on.Long story short, I would definitely come back here but only if I was nearby and was craving poke. A good chain brand nearby would unfortunately get my business, at least unless this place improved.This isn't meant to be a dig, just an honest review. Btw I went 3 stars instead of 2 because of the cash back and check-in offer.Cheers!Useful 5FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationP.

"Thanks for the great pictures and your kind comments, Rebecca. Your feedback is very valuable to us. Wishing you a beautiful weekend!9/3/2019Previous reviewToday was the first time I ever went to this place. I heard it opened up not too long ago and knowing that I loved sushi and sushi burritos I had to go try it out. Walking in, the place itself is very small but is very clean. It's not loud and it wasn't busy when I came. The lady that helped me didn't really know what she was doing because I had to keep reminding her what to put on my burrito but she was kind. I payed around $12 for a very tiny rolled burrito that I honestly don't think was worth the price. I asked for scallops and crab and in other sushi places they gave me a very good amount that made a good sized burrito, but in this burrito I had a total of only 5 scallops and two teaspoons of crab meat. Here the burrito was extremely thin and the seaweed paper almost felt like cardboard and was very hard to chew on. I know this place is new that why I'm hoping they correct their mistakes and better their service."

"Being a first time home buyer in a new state is daunting; especially in a spring seller's market. Lindsay is the agent you want to work with if you want a person who can be adaptive, an advocate for you, and quick to respond to your questions and concerns. Lindsay explained, sometimes multiple times, anything I didn't fully understand. It was refreshing to have an agent who was respectful of my concerns and provided her perspective as a homeowner. Lindsay made the home buying process easy and efficient. Lindsay worked extremely well with my loan officer and was in constant communication with both my loan officer and I whenever an issue or question came up. This professional relationship and my preparation before buying the home allowed me to close 18 days earlier that the suggested close date; making my home buying process only 28 days long -- from offer acceptance by seller to close with keys in hand! Lindsay was always reachable by text, call or email and facilitated the signing processes by utilizing DocuSign. If you are looking for a real estate agent in Ohio, stop looking and contact Lindsay Kronk.Useful 1FunnyCool 1Business owner informationLindsay K.Business Owner9/3/2019Thank you for the comments, Luciana!

"Hi Gina,I'm sorry to hear you had a less than ideal experience at our studio. The Original Hot Yoga class is unique in its style and requires more self discipline than you might be used to in your other Asana classes.  We offer a plethora of other yoga styles at our school. If the OHY class doesn't suit your needs you should try out vinyasa class, rocket, or restore."

"Hello Fadra. The only Fadra we have in our system was back in June 2015. If in fact this is the correct person, we recommended a new fan motor and run capacitor. We don't charge $1400 for this service. If this is the right person, we charged a service fee of $89 to diagnosis the system. We would be more than happy to post the invoice if this is the correct person. Once again we will not do any work until the client approves the repairs! We also can beat anyone's price as we are a small family company with low overhead. Stating something false about our family company hurts our business and we believe this review to be fake. Look at our reviews on other websites, we actually do really good work and have had the same clients for years."

"Hello,This is Evan, the owner of Old School Emporium. I was a bit shocked to see your review the other day as my wife and I who own Old School Emporium and spoke with you while you were in had felt you were happy with the store. I just want to help clear up any misunderstandings or confusion and ensure you are content.I am not sure your roommate came to our store when you sent him back as we were open past 7:00 that day.  I put through the last debit card purchase at exactly 7:04pm and checked our receipts to be sure. If he had returned we would have corrected any issues promptly as we pride ourselves on our service and the satisfaction of our customers.I also looked through our till log that tracks every purchase made and was unable to find any purchases from around the time you were in that were for roughly the amount you stated. There was one just over $5 and another just over $7 and the rest were all $20 plus.Our prices at the time were $1.59/lb for the BC apples, $0.79/lb for bananas, and $1.09/ea for avocado, and the cheese stick was $2.00. If the apple was larger at 1lb and the banana as well at 1/2lb then your total would have been about $5.08 for everything. Is it possible you misplaced any money or were given incorrect change elsewhere?If you do feel that it was our doing then please come by the store and we will give you a full refund for the amount you believe you were over charged as our relations with our customers and providing quality food are worth more to us than the money.We do have 4 sizes of paper bags as well as plastic produce bags so I am sorry if they did not meet your needs.  At the time you had said it was fine and that you would just put everything in your purse. If you do need a different bag than we normally use then please ask and we will happily find/make a different one for you.Regards,Evan Mounsey"
"Hello Jon,I messaged you a couple weeks ago via yelp but didn't hear back so I'm not sure if you saw it or not. I just wanted to post here in the hopes you see it and I can help sort out any confusion/concerns about our selection and pricing etc.Around the time of your review we were short on a bunch of produce due to the massive frosts that had affected numerous crops from Vancouver all the way down to southern Mexico(where it got down to -6 C for several nights wiping out up to 80% of certain crops like lettuce in areas) so I am sorry for that. Crops have recovered well and we have a large order of organic produce that just came in last week with some great stuff like romanesco, garnet yams, fresh carrots with the tops on etc...  We try to be very competitive on price with other stores and are less expensive than many. Come this spring when we have access to local pesticide free crops from smaller farms again our prices and selection of quality local produce will be hard to beat downtown. I just got a call the other day from Broxburn farms in Lethbridge and they will have tomatoes and peppers ready for harvest again before the end of March which is exciting news.As for our breads the most expensive loaf we carry is the veggie/cheese topped focaccia from Sidewalk Citizen which is $6.75 so I am not sure what you saw that was marked $12.00, if there was something it was certainly a mistake in labeling.We're a small independent grocer still getting up off the ground and our selection grows a little every week as we get busier so please be sure to stop in again sometime and take a look around. Just this past week we started carrying a delicious selection of gelatto and sorbetto Fiasco Gelato made right here in Calgary.Your feedback is appreciated and please let me know if you have any questions or additional comments that would help to make us better.Thank you,Evan - Old School Emporium"
Thank you for the feedback and wonderful pics! We are happy to hear you got some great stuff and at a price you can enjoy!
"Terence,It's unfortunate that you did not enjoy your first experience at Liberty Massage Boutique. A number of scheduling issues took place this weekend which were extraordinary - several of our therapists came down with a bug within a 48 hour time span and many appointments had to be rescheduled at the last minute. Due to the high volume of schedule changes, a mistake was made whereby the receptionist thought your appointment was confirmed to be postponed and thought it would be opportune to use this window of time to run errands. This was not the case and resulted in your treatment being delayed.  For this our team has sincerely apologized several times, from the receptionist, the therapist (who mustered the energy to come in for your treatment since it was not confirmed to be postponed), and management. A discount was also extended, which you accepted, for your inconvenience. We continue to strive to provide high quality massage therapy treatments and feel grateful to work in a such an understanding community. Thank you,KatherineDirector of Operations, Liberty Massage Boutique"

"Unfortunately I have to cancel pool service soon because I'm moving but Jason, the owner, has been pleasant to deal with and so has Carlos, my pool tech. I don't know my new pool tech that well but he's been very nice so far. The price has been very reasonable for monthly service and when I've had issues in the past Jason has tried his best to remedy them and I appreciate his help. They keep you updated as much as they can and the service is pretty reliable, obviously barring freakishly strong winds here in Henderson. I'll recommend these guys to anyone with a pool that doesn't want to deal with cleaning theirs. Such a timesaver. Also, they send a cute Christmas card yearly. It's the little things!UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationJason F.Business Owner6/12/2020Thank you so much Nicole. We are sad to see you go but wish you the best in your next adventure.

If you could remove this that would be great. Thank you."
") and are NOW notifying clients of the increase in service even though they sent out emails initially that everything would remain the same (email from 2017).Again, the service is GOOD but there is no way I'm paying $20 for my small pool and spa to be serviced. I'm stopping service next month (when the increase takes effect) and currently searching  for another company in hopes that they'd stick to there quoted and accepted service charges. There is no way in 1 year that gasoline and pool chemical prices sky rocketed to cause a $20 increase in my service. I appreciate the service. Thank you.Useful 3FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationJason F.Business Owner7/2/2018Basil,I'm happy to hear you are satisfied with the service but I'm sorry you are disappointed with the price raise. We try very hard not to raise our prices. Every year fuel, chemicals and insurance to name a few increase in price. Everything increases in price for that matter. We absorb these cost year after year in order to keep the price competitive and in line with the high quality service we provide. At some point we, as do all other service providers, we must raise prices. If we could keep our costs form rising we would be able to keep our prices from rising but we have no control over that. I hope you are able to find a service company that will meet your needs. Jason"

" Prius is released.Anyway, I needed the AC fixed. The hoses were leaking and the compressor needed to be replaced, not unexpected for a 15-yr old vehicle. They also found a leaking axle seal and both the oil pan and transmission pan gaskets were leaking. Since we have two cross-country trips of 6,000 and 12,000 miles coming up, I decided to fix the AC & axle and hold off on the gaskets. Devin did not try to talk me out of that decision when I asked how serious the gasket problem was. He agreed it wasn't a safety concern as long as I kept an eye on fluid levels, which I do. I should note that I change my own oil at times, so I know they've been leaking and I wasn't being taken advantage of. I also know about what AC repairs cost, so I felt their prices were in line with what I expected.I was a walk-in, so they were only able to finish the diagnostics that day, but they completed the work on time the next day and for the price quoted. They even kept the van an extra day because I ended up in the ER that morning and didn't get released until after they closed. I don't know if I could have paid less elsewhere or even if the repairs were needed, but I had no reason not to trust what they told me and it wasn't worth it to me to go price-shopping to save a few dollars. Besides, based on my experience with several repair shops around the country, the AAA warranty is pretty hard to beat, especially since it includes labor. Of course, they're betting the parts won't break and I'm hoping they don't. :)Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationValerie S.Business Manager5/31/2014So glad you got the service you hoped for and the the work you expected.

"It's been a while since I had been to a Red Lobster. How I missed those cheddar biscuits!  My sisters were craving shrimp, so they were delighted to have options.  It's always risky for me to go to a seafood restaurant - I'm deathly allergic to shellfish. But I love how their staff will take care of me once I let them know of my allergy, so I feel very safe here.  I had planned on getting my usual fish and chips, but my eye was drawn to their Cajun Chicken Alfredo.  Was I glad I did. Super yummy and super big.  Half went home for tomorrow's lunch!  Served with your choices of sides. The new Kale salad is super good - a big hit with all - even my niece who usually has Ranch on everything! I also enjoyed their lemonade. And my sisters all got their share of shrimp!

I received 2 Walt's Favorite Shrimp ""COMBINATION""'s, a super small salad I didn't order, a small cup with ""TWO CROUTONS"" with no dressing and two baked potatoes.I spoke with Jenny, the Manager, and she was only willing to compensate for 1 combination and 1 scallops order. I explained we threw the scallops away because that's not our preference. It didn't matter so all I could say was okay.  To add insult to injury, I used a gift card and credit card. I'll certainly notify the person that gave us the gift card so they don't purchase anymore. Red Lobster needs to close its doors and open when they're WORTHY of being associated with anything SEAFOOD!!!"

"Rain is everything you want in a business. Friendly service, fast scheduling and very reasonable prices. Our water softener stopped working and I called a few places to come check it. Rain was the only company that would come out without a service charge. As expected our valve was cracked and the unit was not fixable. They gave me a quote for a replacement on a new system which was very fair. We decided to wait to replace it. I decided to have it removed and called a couple plumbers who quoted me very high prices to remove it and cap the water line. I called Rain again and they were happy to come out and do it for me. They gave me a very reasonable price and came out the next morning. The job was done quickly and the old unit removed. I couldn't be happier with the fast friendly service and pricing. When we decide to finally replace it I will definitely be calling Rain!Useful 4Funny 1Cool 1Business owner informationMichael C.Business Owner3/17/2021Thank you for taking time to review our company!  We are very glad you are happy with the service received and we look forward to serving your future needs........Michael, The Rainman"

That's because you didnt read the Groupon.  It says its a DISCOUNT OF $120 off of the $200 package.
"Thank you for your candid feedback. We're sorry to hear that the pita wasn't to your liking. We actually bake our own pita fresh, daily, where it should be soft to the touch and balanced on the palate - it's a traditional recipe with the thickness in mind as we aim for it to have subtle flavor as the stars should be the items you cradle in the pita such as the Mutabbal and Hummus, or our rotisserie chicken with some of the Toom. I hope you can give us another chance to wow you in the future."
" for June of 2019 date. In January our brides mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 Ovarian Cancer. Her doctors told the family if we wanted the brides mother in attendance, we need to move the date up the sooner the better. The church moved things around and graciously gave a date within 30 days. Ashley Castle could not accommodate that date, so we respectfully requested a partial refund, given the fact that they had 5 months to rebook that date. We didn't even receive the favor of a reply, which in my mind is so disrespectful. Yes we understand we signed a contract. A contract I would think isdesigned to protect Ashley Castle from young couples who break up orelope or for whatever reason just plain change their minds and decide not to get married on the date they have contracted with you.We did not change our minds, we did not break up, we did not elope. Wehad life throw us a curve ball that we never saw coming. We were not atrisk of losing a 2nd cousin or an aunt or uncle from attending our wedding, we were at risk of losing the Mother of the Bride. Which in our minds, and hopefully yours as well, would have been just plain unacceptable.We were willing to concede $ 571.00 of the $1571.00 we paid on or about June 14, 2018 as compensation for the 2 tasting dinners we attended and any other cancellation fee which might be assessed. However the remaining $1000 plus $2500.00 that was paid by the Brides Father, we respectfully requested be refunded to us. The contract states that if we had missed the $2500.00 payment you would have been within your rights to cancel our contract for non payment. So if the Brides Mother had been diagnosed on December 15th instead of January 15th we would not have lost that $2500.00? The $3500.00 we respectfully requested be refunded would have gone a long way towards all of the medical bills that are piling up.A big part of the appeal of Ashley Castle is that you are a locally ownedfamily business, not a heartless national chain. I would think if anycircumstance would merit your compassion to a family already dealingwith a very uncertain future, it would be this one.Our Bride wanted nothing more than to be one of those Brides that haswritten a glowing review on your testimonial page. She grew up wantingthe Fairy Tale Wedding that would have been completed with a receptionat Ashley Castle. One of the video's on your Facebook page touts ""A Fairytale Beginning to your Happily Ever After"" but without Kristens mother in attendance it would have been more of a nightmare.Not only did our family not receive one dime back from Ashley Castle we never even received the courtesy of a reply to our request for consideration. Do yourself a favor and SKIP The Ashley Castle they only care about your wallet not your family or your big day.Useful 6FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationThe Ashley C.Business Manager7/12/2019We are disheartened by this review. The Ashley Castle was notified 4 months prior to Kristen's wedding date, of her mother's illness. We greatly sympathized with her concern on waiting to have their wedding and went above and beyond to try to accommodate her and her groom. They both expressed an interest in pushing up the date here at the Castle. We met with them immediately to brainstorm a solution.We offered earlier dates and were willing to waive any rescheduling fees, they denied. Additionally, we offered different packages to reduce the expense, they denied. We tried everything in our power to help them in this time of need. Cancer is something we are all unfortunately affected by in one way or another, and we have the deepest compassion for this bride's situation. Contractually, we are not obligated to offer or do any of these things. When a bride and groom put money down on a date we no longer sell that date. Furthermore, we were unable to re-book this date after the cancellation so we too were negatively affected. As stated in line 3 of the contract Kristen signed;""In the event the RENTER cancels, the deposit payment, along with any payments made as of the date of cancellation WILL NOT BE REFUNDED.""The bride made the required contracted payments to our company, the deposit and midpoint payments totaling $4,071.00. We wish it could have worked out for all and hope for the best outcome for Kristen and her family."
" to attend an event with an alternative model I follow online hosting and her artist friend whose art was on display there, both of them visiting from out of town.  I placed an order with George for a canvas piece by the visiting artist with the model in it since the size I wanted was not available in store.  Then I waited patiently two months for this piece to show up with no word from the gallery as to what the status of my order was.  I finally called them to check up on it and was told there was an issue with the publisher but they were working on making it happen still.  I waited another month and a half, AGAIN with nobody contacting me to let me know where my order stood.  I called a second time to be told the co-owner and publisher had a falling out and it would no longer be possible for the gallery to fill my order so the only thing left was to get my refund.  Easy enough, right?  WRONG!   We established the week before Christmas a refund check would be issued and sent to me in the mail.  After the holidays came and went and I hadn't received my check I followed up again with an e-mail indicating that, after nearly four and half months since first placing this order, my patience on the matter was fading fast and could I PLEASE get the refund I was promised?  I received a response from George indicating he'd forgotten to send it but would mail it out the next day.  That same night I reconnected with the model for the first time since seeing her at the gallery event and she told me two things that confirmed some suspicions and made me even more irritated with this situation, main one being that the reason George gave me for not being able to fill the order was false and the second being that she herself had an issue getting paid for her appearance at the event by this guy.  Still, I waited an entire week for my refund to show up in the mail which, again, it never did.  I then sent another e-mail indicating that a complaint to the Rio and legal action were imminent if I didn't receive the refund when I went to the gallery to pick it up in person this past weekend.  That got me a voicemail from George saying he was sorry I had gotten so upset, that he had been hospitalized shortly after our communication the week before and that's the reason he hadn't sent the check yet.  I sent him an e-mail response explaining why it'd gotten to the point of me being so mad and we established that I would come pick up the check in person the next day so this could finally be done with.   After all the excuses, poor communication and having my suspicions confirmed by someone who'd been in a similar situation I did a little looking around before going in.  Wouldn't you know it, during the time George claims he was in the hospital he was leaving posts on his Facebook page sounding completely healthy and at least one of them seeming to indicate that he was AT WORK.  Despite being even angrier about the fact that he continued to lie to me after I threatened legal action, I made it a point to keep my cool when I went in so I could just pick up the check and leave without incident.  George, however, was looking to pick a fight with ME and started giving me a crap as soon as he handed me the check.  One would think, him being in a management position and the whole situation with my order dragging out as long as it did, that he might simply offer me an apology or maybe just keep his mouth shut.  Nope!  He started bringing up the whole hospitalization excuse again in an effort to make me look like a jerk and sarcastically saying ""Nice e-mail"" in response to one or both of the messages I'd previously sent explaining my frustration.  I fired back that I saw his Facebook posts and suspected he was not in the hospital for the period of time he claimed he was and therefore could have mailed the check the previous weekend like he promised.  He then raised his voice at me, in front of other customers, and told me not to come back to the gallery (like I'd even WANT to!!) and saying he was just trying to ""do something nice for me""???  As I was walking out on him he even tried shouting a message that, for some reason, he wanted me to pass on to the alternative model's husband.   I'd been dealing with some other stress outside of this that contributed to me wanting to conclude this failed business transaction ASAP but, unlike George, I didn't feel the need to make this a personal issue.  He was too busy trying to make the whole thing all about HIM and his health issues anyway so I wouldn't have had a chance to explain even if I'd tried.  Anyway, this man is unprofessional, unstable, a liar and should most definitely not be managing a sales job or having any kind of contact with the gallery's customers.  I highly recommend you do NOT trust him with your money!Useful 4FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationSam F.Business Owner1/26/2015I do understand your frustration, however this was not our fault. The vendor for this art, Get Down Art, could not fulfill our orders and put us in this position. We tried to fulfill the order in other ways, but in the end were not successful so we of course are giving a full refund. In fact, George was in the hospital with a very serious illness. This former customer has since received his full refund. Greg Frey, Owner."

They were huge stalks and I ended up throwing most of them out. The ends were brown and quality-wise they they just weren't acceptable.So, don't make the same mistake I did and buy celery stalks thinking they are celery hearts because they aren't!This, of course, wasn't Safeway's fault that I chose the wrong product, but it's just another instance of the quality of their packaged produce being unacceptable. See my earlier review having to do with their packaged asparagus.Also, their green onions were ""spindly"" so didn't buy any.This store continues to disappoint.1/22/2021Previous reviewBuyer Beware: Just bought some of their pre-packaged asparagus and had to throw most of it in the garbage due to the tips being bad and unusable. To be fair, I have bought this asparagus in the past and haven't had a problem with it, but if it happens again I will stop buying it.12/22/2020Previous reviewTheir individual rolls appear to have SHRUNK! Was in there today and bought two Kaiser rolls. They were smaller than a regular sized hamburger bun. Just another disappointment from this store. Do they think customers don't notice??? Their buns used to be HUGE. Not any more. I am referring to their Kaiser, Poppyseed and Cheese buns. The only ones that are a decent size are their Dutch Crunch rolls. Guess I'll have to look elsewhere. Why am I not surpried??? Bah Humbug!!!!!10/31/2020Previous reviewWas in this Safeway a few days ago and noticed that their price on Amy's Minestrone soup was Two Dollars ($2.00) HIGHER than any other Amy's soup on their shelf. If this isn't PRICE GOUGING, I don't know what is.All of their Amy's soups, with the exception of the Minestrone, are $4.49. Even at $4.49 they are NOT a bargain and can be found for less at almost any other store. The Minestrone soup, however, is a WHOPPING $6.49!!!!! Who, in their right mind, would pay $6.49 for a can of soup?????I seriously doubt that anyone at Safeway will read this, let alone respond (they never have in the past), but it is my intention to contact Amy's and make them aware of this situation.For those who are interested, Natural Grocers sells the Amy's line of soups for a more reasonable price. Sprouts has them (or used to have them) for $3.49 and when they are on sale $2.79!! Fry's regular price on these soups is (or used to be) $2.59!!! I haven't checked the Sprouts or Fry's price recently, so it may have changed, but I doubt it is $6.49!!!Shame on you, Safeway.Sign me: Another dissatisfied customer10/14/2020Previous reviewUnless they have moved this product, it appears they have discontinued the Bar Harbor line of stocks and soup. If so, just another inconvenience as a result of shopping this store. Fortunately, A.J.'s across the street sells it.9/1/2020Previous reviewIs there some reason they are no longer carrying eggs in cartons of six (6)? Handy for those of us who can't use a carton of twelve (12)? Not that they have ever cared about being handy or anything else for that matter. For those who need eggs in cartons of six (6) Whole Foods has them. I dare say other stores do too, but don't know for sure.8/27/2020Previous reviewThis is what you can expect if you buy their Pita Crackers. Am so tired of paying for inferior food at this store. Won't be buying this Open Nature brand again. What more can I say?8/21/2020Previous reviewUnbelievably they sliced all of their Artisan bread today! We like their Como, Pugliese and Ciabatta, but WE DO NOT WANT IT SLICED! We like these breads because they are rustic and perfect to serve with, say, spaghetti and meatballs, but WE WANT TO SLICE OUR OWN BREAD!!! So, we left empty handed. What is wrong with them?? Why would they do something like this??? Fortunately, we had half a loaf of Costco's country french bread in our freezer, which we defrosted, so our meal wasn't completely spoiled. No thanks to Safeway.6/27/2020Previous reviewIn the past week or so, I have bought living butter lettuce that was brown and unusable ($2.99). Had to be thrown in the garbage. I was overcharged for sliced watermelon. The final insult was two yellow onions both of which were unusable. They were discolored and soft and mushy around the edges when cut into. How this store stays in business I will never know. The Fountain Hills store is so much better. It is out of my way, but might be worth the 20 minute drive to avoid buying unusable produce and not be overcharged. What can I say other than THE BEAT GOES ON, and on and on and on ..."

"Richard,  As you well know.. We do not, nor can we wipe reviews!  Also, when you write a second review because you say we wiped the first one you might want to include our entire response instead of what suits you.  This is the wife (Cindy) and I did not witness what you said in your review.  I (Cindy) also wrote the response to your first review.  You were not assaulted and you know it.  Where is the police report?  Remember you called the Police and no report was taken because you were asked to leave only (witnessed by another customer).  Please keep this up and we will be forced to talk to an attorney for defamation of character as nobody called you about your reviews or threatened you.  And now you are telling potential customers to bring pepper spray and a witness.  It is obvious that there was nothing we could of done to make you happy.10/10/2016Previous reviewI tried this guy again, thinking I must have caught him on a bad day. He has multiple excuses as to why he can't do the job right. Had him install a seat cover on a motor cycle seat. He said it ""would look like new"" The cover was on crooked. Took it back and asked them to see what they can do. When I came back to pick it up the second time, I looked it over and before I said anything, Craig said: ""live with it."" ""You just have to learn to live with it"". One heck of a statement to make before I even said anything. But, it still was not straight. I reminded him he said it would look like new and he replied that ""all new seat covers are crooked"". Craig's attitude and demeanor was horrible.. He was loud and in my face trying to intimidate me (I'm 70 years old). I told him I was going to post negative reviews because everyone should know how he does business. He grabbed my arm and shoulder, shoving me toward the door and said ""get out"". I called the police. I will not tolerate being assaulted. He lied to the police and said I (70 years old) had refused to leave the store and that I had started an altercation. His wife was the only witness.Not only does this guy do poor work, he is a jerk when there is a problem.I posted this on Google Reviews and His reply to my negative post was: "" They have a pill for this Richard. Craig"" gives you an idea of what he is like. Just read his reply to my Google post, remember he started in on me before I said anything about his second do-over and remember I had to call the police. If you do business with him, remember to bring pepper spray and a witness.P.S. He called me and said the negative post  I made made won't matter because he and his friends ""post all the positive posts he needs.""  He also said he will be watching for me -- whatever that means. For Pete's sake! Do I now have to watch over my shoulder for this guy?Read all the posts on Yelp."

"This was my first experience with a walk in chiropractor. I was greeted as soon as I walked in. It had a different setup than what I was expecting but nothing too far fetched. I filled out some paper work and waited for the doctor. The doctor went through the process with me, in detail but fairly quickly, I think it's just the nature of the job, in and out , next patient to patient , so naturally she talks fast. I received some good information about why we should or need to see this type of treatment . I did receive an adjustment and most of it was completely new for me, so naturally it took me a second to get used to the jerks and cracks. They did recommend a treatment plan but I needed to sleep on it. Overall I decided that this type of treatment wasn't for me . I'm kind of scared of it lol If you enjoy this, I would recommend it especially if you're busy and need a convenience of going whenever even later in the evenings . Pricing wasn't bad either . I just can't bring myself yet to get jerked and cracked lol . I'm too scaredUseful 2FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationMia T.Business Owner10/8/2020Thank you for sharing your experience with us!"

"I'd like to give my side of this story. I've been doing furniture repair since 1983. I've done over 16,500 furniture repair jobs and this is the only one out of thousands who made a complaint. I'm very sorry for this lonely woman who has to have 2 very disturbing dogs to make her feel safe. I even told her to be careful of a lawsuit in case the dogs harm someone. Tess has 2 dogs who were inside her house as we spoke on her porch. They were large dogs and appeared to be similar to Pit Bulls. They were jumping on the screen door from inside the house. They were barking viciously and bumping the door to get out where I was. My job was to go inside and survey the damage for the moving company. I told Tess to please put the dogs in a separate room but she explained she could not. I then explained I could not go inside unless the dogs were separated from where I had to work. I have been bitten by dogs from owners who swore their dogs were friendly. I love dogs and have one of my own. I only wish the best for this woman and her dogs."

"Located in the Southend, this spot is everything you could want from a watering hole. Everything is reasonably priced. The vibe is fun. The ambiance is inviting. We started off with the hickory smoked wings. Half in the Western NC BBQ and the other half in the Carolina BBQ. These wings were amazing. They were so good, we ordered them the following day too! For our main entree, we selected the combo platter, Lil Bit (CHOOSE 4: PULLED PORK, PULLED CHICKEN, BEER CAN CHICKEN, ST. LOUIS RIBS, CAROLINA BEEF BRISKET OR TEXAS BEEF SAUSAGE with 2 sides). Ribs, brisket, sausage and the beer can chicken were our choices. With the sides being sweet potato fries and coleslaw. The ribs were the best out of the four selected. The chicken coming in a close second. It says that the Lil Bit combo platter feeds two, but it fed three on this night.  If you're looking for someplace fun without breaking the bank, this is your go to. With an outside patio to enjoy people watching, this place is highly recommended for locals and tourists alike.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationLily A.Business Customer Service4/22/2021Thanks for the great review, Kevin.

"First and foremost, my sincere sympathy over the passing of the loved one whose funeral you attended.  The guest book you signed is given to the family immediately following the ceremony as a way for them to remember and acknowledge those who attended the service. I can promise you that we've never taken this information for our use, or shared the personal information of any of our family members or visitors.  We don't conduct business in this manner, and certainly never will. Any correspondence from us to you at this time was, very simply, an unfortunate coincidence and I'm terribly sorry this happened.

"Amanda, I can understand your frustration with your experience at Signatures today. Your comments are well received and they will be used as a teaching opportunity and a good reminder. Our staff should never allow our busy work to interfere with our first priority of taking care of the customer. We have been buried with holidays deliveries and admittedly have been working at a intense pace to get the merchandise processed and moved to an offsite storage unit. This is still no excuse for the lack of attention you received. I apologize that you invested time to research and visit the store to leave empty handed. I sincerely extend my apologies and ask that you would consider Signatures for a future visit.  Wendy Byrne"
"Peggy B.I am very sorry that Signatures won't be your ""go to"" gift store anymore. I understand that it is often disappointing when a favorite jewelry line or other special find is no longer available to you. Your comment was from January 4th, 9 days after our busy holiday season. The store's selections are always depleted at this time as we are waiting for new merchandise to arrive. I will be going to Atlanta market next week to purchase new merchandise.  From a business perspective, Signature has to evaluate and react to the demands of our customer base as a whole.  After 22 years of operating this neighborhood boutique, I realize that phasing out a product line when interest fades and introducing new is what keeps Signatures fresh. I strive to appeal to everyone coming through the doors, young and old. We have a diverse selection in jewelry and home goods.  Natural Life is a colorful line predominately loved by a younger demographics, gifts starting at $8.00. This has been a favorite item for daughters and granddaughters. Kendra Scott is a large jewelry line appealing to all ages and has been a big hit.  Brighton has jewelry selections from $25.00 or leather handbags as high as $460.00. Two new lines that we brought in recently are Enewton Jewelry, classic silver and gold pieces with a modern flare and Tula Blue with a boho vibe.  Both have been well received. Dealing with the fact that online shopping has taken a huge financial volume from brick and mortar stores such as Signatures, it requires me as the store owner to pay extremely close attention to purchasing trends. I do everything in the interest of my loyal customers. I appreciate the support and patronage that I receive from the familiar faces that do consider Signatures their ""go to"" gift store."
"Great place to get Botox. I have heavy eyelids and often looked tired. With the doctors skill and Botox I look refreshed. The staff is friendly, easy to get an appointment or use the Botox Bar. They have all the covid measures in place and they participate in the Brilliance Distinctions program, which is quite a savings. Beautiful reception area too.Useful 2FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationPeter C.Business Owner10/1/2020We are so happy that you came to visit.

"We have a very small parking lot with construction being completed right now.  Like you, the parents dropping off their children to the school behind our office use our parking lot for a loading and unloading zone. The parking lot is posted for business use only and not for school use. The parents have been towed out of the parking lot by the owner of the building, not the owner of our dental office on numerous occasions. The parking spot specifically you were parking in is POSTED for patient parking only. We happened to have 3 elderly patients arriving soon that needed the parking spots.  I am sorry you were upset that we had asked you to kindly park somewhere else for a school drop off."
"Made an appointment for an Ultrasound. Check in was 7:30am and Appt 8am. Arrived at 730 and was promptly checked in, called over for my insurance and id information. Paid my copay and sat back in the waiting area for about 2min until I was called back. The whole appointment went by without issues. The tech was professional and I was in and out quickly. The waiting area was clean, all employees were masked and hand sanitizer was provided and I was asked to pump it into my hands prior to touching anything and grabbing my own pen. Would definitely visit again if needed, easy process, clean facility and friendly, organized and professional staff all around.Useful 4Funny 2Cool 4Business owner informationStacey W.Business Employee2/23/2021Thank you so much for the wonderful review."

"Edit: Stacy reached out to me directly to get my information, to express her own apologies and to reassure me that this was not par for the course for this location. I am adding a star for her taking the time to care, because very few people in this location seemed to last Wednesday. The receptionist is the only competent person in the building. After arriving early, I was still made to wait 30 minutes to check in and pay my copay, only to be told that it would be another 45 minutes until they could see me and then another 30 minutes for my exam. From the scheduling process to the actual exam this place is awful. They have terrible excuses and a lot of angry people in the waiting room. The check-in clerks literally sat for 20 minutes discussing 4th of July plans with a waiting room full of clients. I wish my insurance used ANYONE else.

" corp taxes at the recommendation of our new bookkeeper and all I can say is that we now regret it dearly. After being told that they would work together and get things sorted out for us asap and agreeing to pay their high prices for what was said to be quality Bookkeeping & CPA work, we waited for months to even hear back from them on the status of our tax filing. This was somewhat expected due to their high volume of returns in tax season but concerned we called Carla's office and were told that an extension was filed weeks back and that everything should be done within a couple months. Sometime later we received our 2016 corp return as promised however it was not aligned accurately with what our 2016 books were reporting as promised. In addition to that, they also decided to tack on a few hundred dollars worth of extra charges to our bill which was not disclosed to us up front and seemed to appear out of thin air. We contacted Carla again to see what was going on with the differences and she informed me that she would look into it and get back to us. We paid her her fees as agreed for the work performed in good faith thinking that she would make things right in the end and guarantee her work, but here it is several months later and just a couple weeks away from the final tax deadline and nothing has been done. Maybe others have had a different experience with Carla and her staff, but based on ours we cannot recommend her services and will definitely not be using her ever again.Useful 1Funny 1CoolBusiness owner informationCarla D.Business Owner9/28/2017Thank you, Aaron, for taking the time to write this lengthy review.  With over 30 years as a CPA it is always been my aim to please our clients and I take their taxes seriously.  Obviously, some misunderstandings have taken place and for that I am truly sorry.  According to my records your 2016 return was filed so if you would please contact my office at your earliest convenience I would like to get this cleared up for you."

"1 check-inIt was just an okay experience.  Waitress seemed a little perturbed and not all that friendly.   As for the game play, the concept is good with multiple games but the programs are glitchy.  We were playing a game hit 3 balls then go to next player and hit their name on the screen.  It looked like the computer switched over but the score registered to the previous player. It wasn't like we were playing fast either.  Other people I've spoken to had similar issues.Also, balls are in bad shape.  I've seen better at range.  But these balls seemed hard and feel dead.  Probably made just for Topgolf to keep balls from going to far.  Clubs were basic.  I don't know if taking your own would make a difference with those crappy balls. As for the food, it was pretty good bar food.  We had some chips and melted cheese thing along boneless wings.  All were pretty good.  Try to get upper deck.  Much cooler view up there.This place would get 4 stars if they would fix their computer glitches.  Games are fun and the drinks good.Useful 1Funny 1Cool 2Business owner informationHugh D.Business Customer Service5/27/2021Hi Wesley.

" I went to the Cycle Gear on Reems Rd. to have new tires mounted and balanced. The guys they had doing the mounting and balancing made it obvious they didn't want to do the work. The guy I was first talking to told me he had to get someone else To do it because he was leaving in 30 mins. The next guy got my info and starting looking for the tubes for my tires ( I called ahead to make sure they had them ) He said he was only able to find the front tube and they wouldn't mount my tires until they received the rear tube, so i told him I would go purchase a new rear tube from another place in town and bring it to them. He seemed hesitant but I let him know I needed them done because this is the only time I could do it because I ride the bike to work during the week (went to Ride Now to get the rear tube). By the time I got back they started the front tire. Rear tire was left unattended on showroom floor. Had to find someone in the back to give them the new rear tube. Took them an additional 2 hours to get them done, only to find out they were done incorrectly on my way to work when the front end started to sway on the freeway. Which it has never done before. I called Monday to speak to a manager after work to let him know the situation and that I noticed they had left old weights on one side of the rim. The manager argued that the tires left the ""shop"" perfectly balanced and that it didn't matter that the old weights were still on. And after he told me he has been doing this for a long time and knew what he was talking about I asked him when his balancer was recalibrated. He admitted seemingly proudly that it was around a year to a year and a half that the procedure was done. Which in reality this should be done at the very least twice a month but in reality should be done every morning to ensure safety for anyone who gets their tires balanced (especially for motorcycle tires). After giving him this information he apologized and offered a full refund and a free rebalance. I made him aware that I would prefer to go to a different location due to the Obvious lack of knowledge and ""want to"" at his location. If I was a beginner Rider I could have lost my life due to the lack of attention these people had. Want to keep two wheels down? Don't go to the cycle gear on Reems Road for Mount and balance.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationKiersten T.Business Manager4/12/2021Lance, we are so sorry about your experience - this is not the Cycle Gear difference we pride ourselves on.

"MY STORY: I've been working as a nurse for almost 2 years on a critical care floor, and it has severely affected my body the last 3 months. I always come home achy but after my hot shower, stretch, and ice routine I am good. I get a basic massage every few months and I'm satisfied. But man, the last 3 months my neck and lower back has become stiffer, sore, and intolerable. I saw a chiropractor for a month and it was immediately relief, but I'll tense up again after an hour. I thought to myself... I am too young to see a pain specialist (I'm 24F) and I need to get this under control before I cripple myself. My friend recommended me to Scott and now I'm a believer in eastern and western techniques. MY EXPERIENCE: I didn't know what to expect because I kept reading that this wasn't a ""relaxing"" massage but a massage that will fix me. He started off with seeing how strong my upper and lower limbs were, and if one was weaker, he would do these acupuncture techniques and press on certain areas of my body, then repeat the test and surprisingly I did gain strength. It's crazy because when I work out, my trainer would always correct my form because I would favor my right side. I'm writing this review 3 weeks after the massage, and I've noticed a huge difference in my squats in terms of balance and stability. I asked him to focus on my concerned areas (neck, shoulder, and back) and he did an amazing job with loosening the ""knots and tension."" There were some painful moment but I was able to relax and at some point I almost fell asleep. It's difficult to compare his technique to other people because it's that different. It's better than any other deep tissue massage I've received and at the end of the session I felt less restricted and tight. During the next few weeks (with continued stretching too), I felt less muscular pain and weakness. I also felt stronger and more balanced in the gym and at work. OVERALL: He's pricy but definitely worth it. I already booked my next appointment.Useful 8Funny 3Cool 9Business owner informationScott Z.Business Owner9/29/2019Thank you Leslie.

" in terms of the grainy texture, the Oreo Cheesecake not so different from the Cheesecake options at Pink Box, perhaps because of the thicker consistency of the Cream Cheese and ground up Cookie filling.Rounding out the morning with a stuffed Donut titled ""Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough,"" the same stiff Cream from Italian Rum and Chocolate filling from Rocky Road found beneath an upright-standing half-Cookie, there was absolutely nothing about this Donut that suggested Cookie Dough save for the Cookie itself, the owner's son Steven reaching out on Social Media less than 6-hours later to state ""We are actually in the midst of developing an improved cookie dough filling that is shelf stable and will really give it the flavor deserving of its name.""TWO STARS:  I think it is fairly obvious that I like Donuts and I'm also pretty fond of Aquariums, so although I'm not really sure what Tanked has to do with DONUT MANIA aside from one of the Stars saying he was ""the money and marketing"" at the Grand Opening in North Las Vegas yesterday morning I do know that the event and product was a mess, the stars of the show placing themselves inside already limited confines and thus constraining traffic while the product was rarely worth the price.See all photos from Michael U. for Donut ManiaUseful 12Funny 7Cool 8Business owner informationBrett R.Business Owner11/21/2017Hey Michael, as always thank you so much for your feedback!  I'm happy to report that the soft ice cream problem has been resolved and we will make sure our bakers are adhering to our recipes and standards to ensure the highest quality product.  We're excited for the release of new flavors in the coming weeks along with our improved Chocolate Chip Cookie Doughverload.  Hope you get a chance to try them and if there is anything else we can do to improve our service donut hesitate to let us know!"

"Hello, Jessica C.,We so appreciate you taking the time out of your day to write your honest review. It truly helps us to reflect on our practices and assess where we can improve in serving our families - especially our children. Upon review of your concerns, we were able to take a look at the teachers that have worked with your child, and as your scheduled days and times in attendance are inconsistent, it makes sense that you would see different teachers - we are open for extended hours, so the teachers in the morning are different than the teachers in the evening. Plus, we do have ""floaters"" - teachers that cover during lunch breaks - which means there may be a different teacher in the classroom at drop-off if the lead teacher is on break. As for your concern with the cameras, based on our records, you currently have access to cameras. We do go through and make adjustments regularly in paperwork, payments, and up-keeping documentation, and we await your collaboration to update the paperwork we requested - which contributed to the camera app being temporarily disconnected. Please remember this is a fee based service that requires current paperwork. We hope that we have solved your concerns thoroughly and look forward to seeing your child again soon. Sincerely, The McCarran Int'l Child Development Admin Team"

"Good morning Alexandra M. I told you right from the beginning you should check out our color selection if it match your color and you were on the phone the whole time. You walked in the nails salon to fix two nails and were told about 30 min wait and you are ok with that. Everyone here had a appointments ahead of time. You should know my salon is full of customers and i still try to help you within 10 min not 30 min as i said. Your fingers got cuts, bruised, damaged everywhere after the trip from Rocky point. I tried to fix and glued the rest of the nails and even gave the band aids wishing it heals first before i can do anything. I fixed only two full lenght tips without .cutting them and ask you nicely is it ok because it is still shorter than your nails and you said it is ok since it is long already so it won't make any different. During the whole process of fixing nails you kept pulling the finger and move around while still talking on the phone which slowed down the process and impossible for me the perform the nails art. On one damaged nails i said i let it heal first because it will be infected if i put the nail on . Since you can't find the color match from our over 700 gel color selections, i have to let you sit there to pick out your color you wanted and move on to my appointmented customers. At the end, when you said you only paid for one nail fix, two waiting customers almost got out of the chairs to fight with you because they saw the whole things.i don't want things happen likes that so i only charge you $7 for my 30 min of works , all my clients told me you should charged her the whole things not $7 dollars. I have to let you go so my clients will continuing to have a wonderful time here. I am sorry the inconvenient which may have caused you. Happy Easter"

"Thank you Tristan for your honest feedback.  I just wanted to share that I have purchased Tack Solutions and have officially taken over as of July 1, 2016.  My goal is to make this store an amazing resource for all horse people. We are aiming to make consigning a simple and painless process and offer flexibility that meets our customer's needs.  Please consider giving our store another look as we have also made some changes in the store itself to make things more organized and affordable. Hope to see you soon.Lori martinezOwner Tack Solutions11/3/2015Previous reviewDrove 45 miles each way with a load of tack to consign, they refused to take it because it was Tuesday. Wouldn't even allow me to leave it when I explained how far I drove. Was told that people drive further and are refused, as if that's helpful. The clerk pointed to 2 large racks full of gear that had been consigned but was not put out yet, due to back log.Clerk said I should have called?! Really?! I checked the hours online. Should be able to provide the services advertised during business hours. If the employees are not able to hand out a consignment contract, then you need new employees. I see why the business is for sale, still."
Hi.  I am the new owner of Tack Solutions Lori.    I am so sorry you feel you had a bad experience at our store.  Since taking over we have been working extremely hard to reorganize the store and lower prices.  Our excellent customer service is our main focus as we desire to be an excellent community resource for horse people of all disciplines.  We research each and every item that we place on our floor to determine a fair and reasonable price for both our consigners  as well as buyers. I would love to have you give us another chance and I would love to wait on you personally. Thank you so much and Again I am so sorry for your experience.
"Thank you for reaching out, I’d like to make 4 important remarks to you: 1- we have no interest in losing a customer over a 2 dollar lugnut, if we said you’re missing one, then you were missing one. If you have doubts, simply ask us to review the 16 cameras we have installed in the shop2-Tire rotation is the practice of moving the wheels and tires of an automobile from one position to another, to ensure even tire wear. Even tire wear is desirable to extend the useful life of a set of tires.The weight on the front and rear axles differs which causes uneven wear. With the majority of cars having the engine in front, the front tires typically bear more weight than the rear tires which wears the front tires quicker. At the time of your visit, my notes show your front tires had higher tread, which means a tire rotation was not needed. Which is also why you were never charged for a tire rotation3-You cannot install a wrong spin-on oil filter, if it’s the wrong oil filter, it will not fit and leak all the oil before it even leaves the shop causing engine failure. Maybe you mean the height of the oil filter?! Which depends on the brand name you use. For example: filters for the same car made by Valvoline and mobile 1 have different heights. 4-when in doubt, always ask for camera footage. Come by any day and we’ll buy you a lugnut, no need to stress out over 2 dollars and a tire rotation when you can simply ask for it. Don’t let our professional advice get in the way of what you want. Thank you for sharing your feelings, Don’t be shy next time, simply ask. Have a good day."
"Thank you for sharing your feedback Madam, but as I discussed with you on the phone previously, I simply cannot cover a warranty on a job that we did not perform. You completed your work with a previous owner (Differenty Entity, Different staff, Different LLC) at this location, 4 months before i even considered buying this shop and still resided in Michigan. I have no way to confirm what was done on your vehicle, who worked on it, whether they used after market parts or whether they were even qualified to perform the job. I understand your frustration that your water pump failed even though you had the previous company replace it, however would you be frustrated with me if i had opened a flower shop or gas station here. Whats right is right, i suggest your frustration be directed on either the manufacturer of the water pump or the previous company, please re-consider who you are holding responsible here, we simply bought the shop (with the property) and just want to make an honest living. We stand by all the work we do. Your consideration is highly appreciated, please let us know how we can help in any way. Thank you."

"We always provide a service quote before work starts.  We also 'scoff' at used bicycles because more often than not they have various issues that require alot of repairs, i.e. A customer buys a used bicycle somewhere for $60-150 they ask us what it will take to work and often to be considered in 'good working order'  requires repairs worth more than the price of the bike in the first place.  That is why we scoff at used bicycles.We also have a saying, the only good used bike is a stolen one.  Nobody is going to get rid of a bike that works well and doesn't have issues.You're welcome for the free air."

". We lived in the B4 floor plan and never felt so comfortable. The apartment was absolutely gorgeous, so well made and intentionally designed. We truly felt like Camden Tempe was our home. We went through many managers of the property but the managers right now, Lisa and Lonnie exceeded expectations. They were incredibly kind, helpful and assertive. Camden Tempe never felt better!! They both are open for conversation and take care of residents needs as fast as they possibly can. We will forever miss having apartment managers like them. Although the area of North Tempe/south scottsdale has struggled with more transient people recently, we really feel like management is doing everything they can to help this issue, and we never once had an actual issue with this problem. Camden's location is so central and extremely accessible. We were able to enjoy Tempe, Scottsdale and Phoenix while being able to drive down to the east valley as well very easily. The amenities are great, and we especially loved the pool. Maintenance was friendly and hard working as well. We will forever miss Camden and will always have fond memories there.

"Hi There, I'm so happy to hear that you are enjoying the living space of your apartment home, but we have a ways to go with ensuring that you aren't having frustrations around parking. I'm sorry that you are disappointed with that aspect of your living experience here. Because we don't have the space, we reserve the parking inside of the gates for residents only. I definitely acknowledge that visitor parking can get taken quickly in the 15 marked visitor spaces in front of the Leasing Office. We currently have a total of 51 visitor spaces which includes the overflow parking on the West and North sides of the community outside of the gates. If you would like for me to show you those areas, please let me know and I will be happy to help. The only places that visitors can't park without the risk of being towed is the permit spaces (for residents only), the reserved covered parking spaces, or the commercial parking lot North of the overflow parking. We regularly remind residents that doing so can result in getting their vehicle towed. Camden Tempe receives no money from the towing company for monitoring and towing from our parking lots. The good news is that with our Phase 2 we will be adding somewhere around 40 extra visitor spaces between our Phase I and Phase II. Those should be available for use sometime this summer. In addition, we will be installing a pedestrian gate on the West side of the community so that guests can easily get from overflow into the community when the resident gives them access through the Chirp app. Phase 2 will only have assigned covered parking spaces for residents and no garages. I'd love an opportunity to chat with you and see if we may have the ability to switch your garage for a carport instead. We don't have a lot that are available, but depending on the size of your apartment home and your location in the community we do have a couple of possible options. If that interests you at all, please contact me directly and I would be happy to help. Also, if you are ever experiencing any future frustrations please feel free to call or email me. I'm always available to talk through these concerns with residents. Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback.

"Hi Tedd, We are disappointed to hear your experience with us has not been great. We would love to discuss your concerns further in person or over the phone to find a way to make it right and/or gain more insight. Please email us at Hayden@camdenliving.com with your availability. We understand parking may have changed since you first moved in, however we chose to forego this for the benefit of our residents. Last year, we received feedback from our residents in regards to no parking, as visitors were taking up a majority of permit parking. With this, we decided to only assign permits to those residents whom do not have an assigned garage/carport such as yourself. We do however offer temporary permits for short term visitors and are more than happy to assist with these, please visit our office for more details. Again, please do not hesitate to reach out to us directly at 480-584-3330 or Hayden@camdenliving.com with your availability so we may find a way to turn your experience around. Thank you."
"Good morning Marissa,We're sorry your initial experience hasn't been up to Camden standards. We've had changeover in the office in order to correct these issues, and make our community one of the best in Tempe. Our new team has already begun taking steps to give our residents the Camden experience, including implementing a new parking system. We invite you to stop by the office to speak with us about your concerns so that we can help make the rest of your time here at Hayden the best it can be! Have a great weekend!"

Very important to endure the severe Arizona summers. The clubhouse is open 24/7, the weight room is 2 stories, and the community itself is flawless. Not to mention our leasing agent, Molly, was an absolute pleasure. I will recommend ANY Camden property to those in need of a stress free experience. 10 stars!Useful 1Funny 1Cool 1Business owner informationCamden ManagerBusiness Manager12/30/2018Thank you for your kind words! We are so happy to have made your experience stress free and could find you the perfect apartment home for your needs. It was my pleasure to be able to get you moved in within a few hours. Please let us know if there's anything we can do to continue to make your experience living in our community great. Welcome home!-Molly"
"Hi Caitlynn,Thank you so much for taking the time to tell us about your experience. At Camden Hayden it is our goal to provide our residents with Living Excellence and it sounds like that is exactly what you're receiving. Don't hesitate to take advantage of our awesome referral bonus for residents. Stop by the office if you have any questions about it."
"We are sorry to hear you had this experience. We pride ourselves on providing Living Excellence and would love the opportunity to speak with you so we can improve our service. We could not find you as a registered resident in our system to call you. Would you be willing to call us at 480-584-3330? Thanks again for your feedback and we look forward to hearing from you.1/30/2018Previous reviewI've been a resident at Camden Hayden for two months & I am more than happy to be a part of the community. The complex grounds are always clean due to their amazing maintenance team. Service requests are always finished quickly as well. Also, everyone in the office is very friendly and I enjoy visiting for a quick chat when grabbing coffee. If you're looking for a modern, quiet place to live, Camden Hayden is my recommendation. Make sure to say hi to Jalisa, Robby, & Rudy !"
"Greetings Kimberly,Thanks so much for your time here at Camden Hayden! We love to hear from our residents and appreciate feedback no matter in what forms it comes and I am happy that you call us home. As it turns out, or aim is not to provide you with an excuse in regarding to having security, rather, we are partnered with Tempe PD as we have found that they are the fastest route to our rescue no matter what the occurrence. Crime, for the most part, requires intent and opportunity. Part of our ongoing communication with our residents consists of eliminating the opportunity such as items of value left in view, garages being left open, vehicles left unlocked; while I am in no way implying that you have done any of the above, we ask our residents to be active participants in the battle against crime. Your comfort in your apartment home is our top priority, we would like to shield our residents from facing anything involving crime, there are so many variables involving the act its self.Your residence is appreciated, please forgive us if you were led t believe that an apartment community can give you a sense of security as it implies a feeling that Courtesy Patrol cannot deliver.In closing We care about all of our residents and wish to know which criteria you have used to determine if the persons seen in the hot tub are homeless or not. Perhaps we can even partner with you to address them in the occasions that they are seen. We are happy that our residents have an avenue to communicate between one another through the internal portal. Camden properties are some of the very few that allow this as a medium of communication. We appreciate you Kimberly, and wish that you did not feel this way. Please come in to the office and chat with us, we are happy to hear you and continue to provide you the best living experience, no excuses just a friendly chat with the people who manage your home.Kind Regards,Camden Hayden"

"Dave,Thanks for giving us a second chance. With your next online order, use coupon code FREEHB to receive a FREE Howie Bread with an order of $12 or more. Hope this is useful. Thanks again, HH10/16/2015Previous reviewHungry Howie loves carbs.  I ordered something, it is like a calzone but has almost no filling.  Didn't buy dipping sauce?  Inedible.  I opened a jar of pasta sauce to compensate.  I had the little to no flavor beef with flavorless cheese product.  The quality of the filling is irrelevant because the quantity is overbearing with its absence.I ate here to keep my southwest miles from expiring.  I essentially threw away of $5.  I should have spent .50 on a dipping sauce and nothing else since even .01 will keep my miles current.They are moving the location because it is hard to find and annoying to get to.I really wanted to like this place but it is half as good as Domino's and I will let you take that however you want.  Is it worse than Pizza Hut?  Depends, I hate the hut so it may be close."

"Dear Mr. Bin X.,I am really sorry that you had a bad experience in my office.  Honestly, I don't recall if I had ever deliberately ""spilled anesthetics all over"" my patients mouth. If it happened with you then it must have been an accidental and I sincerely apologize for that.  Is it possible that you tasted the topical anesthetic that we rub on the area before injection? Sometimes patients confuse topical anesthetic with real anesthetics as both have a similar and bitter taste. For the readers of this review by Mr. Bin X,  I would like to clarify that I do not oversell anything. I don't have to because most of my patients are referred from other dentists. If I see something that I think would prevent future problems then I will certainly recommend treatments but getting treatments on these recommendations is patient's decisions.  I believe not informing or educating patients of their problems specially if you have identified it is a disservice. As far as charging for x-ray and consultation is concerned it is a standard practice that every specialist do because we do spend time with the patient examining and evaluating. We do not accept an x-ray or evaluation of a referring dentist because of medical-legal reasons. Reevaluating a referred patients problems is a standard of care which even insurance companies are more than willing to reimburse specialists.  I hope this explanation clarifies any confusion created by Mr. Bin X's review about me or my office."

"I am so sorry that you had such an unfortunate reaction to microneedling and I would really appreciate the opportunity to see it in person. It’s very rare to hyperpigment however, it is a listed side effect. Microneedling is a form of controlled inflammation that stimulates skin regeneration. Sometimes this inflammation masks itself as pigment during the healing process, especially in darker skin types. Fortunately, it’s not permanent. Acne is a more common side effect and microneedling can cause breakouts even in the clearest of skin. Everyone’s skin is different and even though I can make assessments for treatment based on your skin type, I cannot guarantee any outcome. Whether you went to me for microneedling or someone else, you would’ve had the same reaction. I understand that this is not only frustrating but scary. I have and will continue to offer you any of my services to help speed healing and ease your worries.7/16/2018Previous reviewJulia is an angel! When I came in for my consultation a few weeks ago, she took her time providing me with a ton of information and answered all of my (many) questions. Julia is so incredibly knowledgeable and sweet, she treated me as if she had known me forever!The procedure I had done was microneedling. She suggested this as one of the many treatments I would benefit from to help reduce my acne scars and dark spots. I didn't know much about the procedure at all, and Julia did an incredible job making sure I was comfortable. The procedure was a little uncomfortable at times, but overall wasn't bad at all! After the procedure, she gave me all the information I needed for aftercare, and I was on my way.I'm thrilled with my experience and treatment from Julia and I can't wait to return! I'm so excited for my results, but most importantly, I'm so lucky to have found her!"

" Chrysler Pacific and I absolutely loved it.  So many features for a great price. Return was a breeze. There was some construction so a little tricky finding the Advantage return area but followed the signs and got there.  I was alone with my two kids and a little frazzled,  Imad came right up  at car drop off, took the time to say hi and very friendly as well. He took the keys,  reviewed my total charges, and we were done!

"I assume the only reason people rent from here is because they are booking through a discount travel site and have no idea what they are getting into. Everything about the rental experience was a fail. Everyone working was acting like they had never done their jobs before in their lives. It took us over an hour of waiting in line just to get to the reservation counter. On a Sunday afternoon.I also really loved the attempted up-sale at the counter when the woman working tried to convince us that there was no way three women with carry on luggage were never going to fit in the full size sedan we rented. Sure lady. That car was bigger than we needed and she made it sound like we had rented a Miata.If anything this experience will always make me think twice before blindly renting a car through a travel site. These cars are cheap and available for a reason.Useful 5Funny 1Cool 1Business owner informationYumarilis B.Business Owner3/28/2018On behalf of E-Z and Advantage Rent-A-Car we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you underwent while renting with us.

"*Update in response to customer's updated review*Customer did not hire Pearson to pack belongings. Customer originally booked packing service then cancelled packing service and packed herself. Company cannot guarantee the quality of packing provided by customer. Hi Kelli, Thank you for the opportunity to earn your business and we apologize for any concerns with your move. When a customer declines to purchase the necessary insurance for their move they are left exposed to the state mandated levels of coverage for all moving companies to adhere by. We wish you the best in your new home and invite you to give us another chance on your next service. Have a great day.3/5/2021Previous reviewHi are these people for a move on February 26. Movers were nice but broke and ruined several things. When I spoke to the owner Kyle said I had to fill out claims and send him pictures. I did do this. They ruined a brand new Pottery Barn teen bed with black all over it thousand dollar bed they wanted to give me $20 for it. Drop a 55 inch TV off of the top of the truck as they were taking it down with a dolly and wanted to get $50 for it. Other items were ruined also. The customer service is horrible no one will ever return your phone call they will email you. If you want to have a horrible experience hire them otherwise look elsewhere.When I booked  over the phone no one suggested that I was supposed to purchase additional insurance. So that is absolutely not true also you would think that You.  would make it right regardless of the state law. Your guys literally dropped a TV off of the top of a truck. Ruined a brand new bed really an antique dresser and then proceeded to put the TV that was broken on a leather chair. And professional I still tipped  your guys."

"We aren't quite sure what you mean when you say no follow through when contacted and ""they just say I don't know."" Here's what we do know: we certify all repairs, plan and simple. If there is ever a problem, bring it back and we'll make it right. You were unhappy about the price so we offered to pull the replacement parts we had installed, thereby losing out on the labor we had already invested. You decided to pick up your piece. It is unfortunate that it seems our efforts did not appease you, and yet you have not indicated that our repair job was insufficient, only that you intend to have it reviewed. Please feel free to do so. You have left this review and we hope that you will consider updating us when your technician reviews our work. We stand behind our repairs.Our other reviewers often kindly remark upon our reasonable pricing. We really strive to be fair. Sorry it didn't work for your budget."
"We are a very small, family business and we take our work very seriously. I suppose we are a bit confused as we do not and have not ever carried ""low end"" receivers in the $15-20 dollar range. We also stand by our turntables, and have not had a single customer return two turntables - so please remind us which about which turntables you were speaking. If ever a customer were to be in this position, I don't think we would have ""chuckled""."

" - Brian agreed at the completion of service to take off $1k for damages. Not nearly enough to cover what the damages cost, but we met in the middle. After signing the agreement that the final check, less $1000 was paid in full, he sued me for that money.  After reassessing the full cost of damages, including the floor which is now coming up, because he apparently forgot to use glue?!?!? We countersued. Tens of thousands in damages excluding legal fees. The court case is ongoing, his suit was dismissed by the court. Ours still pending.

On July 17th Bob brought in 2 Ipod classics and had crushed one of them with a car seat. He had a solid state hard drive in the crushed Ipod and wanted me to use the good Ipod and put the solid state hard drive from the crushed Ipod in it. He had 2 Ipod classis boxes with various memory cards in the boxes. The next day I realized that the good Ipod wasn't compatible with the solid state hard drive and attempted to contact Bob but voicemail was full. I tried again the next couple days with the same affect.2 months go by and I get a call from Bob and I let Bob know that I tried to contact him but voicemail was full. Bob was informed that if he wanted the solid state hard drive to work he would need to get a compatible Ipod classic. A couple more months go by and I don't hear from Bob.Then Bob shows up very jumpy and moving all over the place and wanted to pick up Ipods and I explained to him per our conversation he was to pick up a compatible Ipod. He seemed to forget our converstion and he just wanted to try to fix himself and I explained to Bob they are very difficult to work on and that I could put them back together for 35.00 and refund the rest. He explained he lost his job and needed to give his girlfriend the money so they didn't get evicted. Feeling sorry for Bob and his situation a full refund of 160 (including 20 tip) was given.Now I see a review where everything is our fault and a refund wasn't given. I can't understand why someone would lie about this when we were only trying to help. If Bob's voicemail wouldn't have been full for months he would've received our messages. I can only assume with all his personal problems he somehow was upset and working on those Ipods he probably became more upset.

"This was our first time using Showtime for our transfer to/from the airport. We pre purchased our tickets online and had our tickets printed. When we arrived at the airport, the Showtime pick up location was easy to find outside the doors. Our shuttle arrived in minutes. The transfer to our hotel did take some time. We got on this small sized bus. Our driver loaded lots of other travelers and I would say the process of loading and checking other passengers took about fifteen minutes. Once passengers were loaded, our driver took us to our destination. We chose the MGM on this trip and luckily, we were the first stop. When going from hotel to airport, we were among maybe a few people going to the airport. We went directly from our hotel there! This may or may not happen to you, you may want to check with them to make sure you have enough to time to get to the airport. We were very satisfied with our choice to use Showtime. The drivers were friendly and drove safely! We'll gladly use them again!Useful 31Funny 21Cool 28Business owner informationJeff R.Business Owner9/8/2016Hi Micki -Thank you for taking the time to share your positive experience using our service.  I will be passing along your comments to our drivers.  It always makes their day!  We look forward to having you aboard in the future.Best,Jeff"
"Whatever you do, do not choose this shuttle service!  This is by far the worst you can experience in Las Vegas. We arrived late at night on a Friday night.  There was a 30 minute way for the taxis, so we thought a shuttle service may be faster.  Showtime looked as though they had the most shuttles so we decided to go with them. We first inquired about their limo/car service but the lady said she couldn't give us pricing on that because they don't take care of that at her station. Yet they advertise it right at the front of her booth?!?!?!

"Dear Ken,I apologize that you had to wait longer than usual for the shuttle to arrive.  We do our best to move them through the airport as quickly as possible, but at times it does slow down.  I will pass comments along to our Airport Operations team.

". Their entry were the Wonchos (wonton skin nachos) topped with mangoes, cloister honey and other goodies. Delicious but very sweet. More of a dessert than an appetizer for me.

"I had the Mongolian chicken bowl with lettuce instead of rice. It was pretty good and is definitely a healthy food truck option. However, I do think the ingredients could be better/more premium for the price.

"Oh darn, every licensed massage therapist knows the day will come when they'll get a bad review...but you are never really ready for it! Especially not being compared to a Petting Zoo :)  I appreciate your very thorough review.In regards to pressure: I provide very light to very deep tissue massage. I try my best to empower clients to be in the driver's seat of their massage, letting them know they can request more or less at any time. Usually with a 2 hour session, a full hour is spent on the back if those areas are the client's chief complaint. One size doesn't fit all for clients when it comes to pressure or technique, which is why I try my best to keep the lines of communication open, while not interrupting your time on the table with needless additional chatter. I sincerely apologize if I didn't communicate this effectively and will be much more careful about it in the future. In regards to technique: Every therapist isn't right for every person and it sounds like we might not have been a match made in heaven. :) My techniques are diverse, and I use additional long flowing connected strokes to give the massage that flowy ""omm"" feeling. This helps those really deep massages to feel more relaxing, and reduces the chances that the client will be sore the next day. The techniques I use are meant for a deeply effective relaxation based massage which relieves stress, muscular tension and soreness. My hope is that my clients' minds will be able to relax just as well as their bodies. Now and Zen is a great choice for relaxing style deep tissue massage, but would not be a good choice for a fast paced, sports-style deep tissue massage. In regards to the relaxation exfoliation shea butter scrubs: I appreciate your feedback. These menu items were created as a more gentle/relaxing and less messy alternative to traditional salt and sugar scrubs. Warm shea butter is massaged over the back and then exfoliation mitts are used to gently exfoliate the skin, afterwards steamed towels are used to wipe away excess butter and add a little moisture. This additional moisture allows the vitamin rich butter to penetrate the skin more deeply. In regards to the abdominal massage: I sincerely apologize for massaging an area that was uncomfortable. I try my best for a very thorough intake. I think it is important to note here that even if abdominal muscles aren't highly toned (like traditional ""abs"" you see in magazines) that they are still there and still in use each and every day. They are quite tense on most individuals regardless of muscle tone or weight and are often overlooked in treatment. Working attachment points for these muscles gently over the sheet can ease a lot of tension in the back for most people, especially lower back tension or that ""stuck"" feeling in the mid-back around the thoracic spine. But there are definitely exceptions and massage isn't ever one-size-fits-all, which is part of what makes it such a beautiful art! Sometimes life is about learning what we don't want, just as much as learning what we do :) Now that we know it is something you don't like, in the future you can let your next therapist know that they can avoid that area. Additionally,  if they are doing anything to make you feel uncomfortable at all, please know you have the right to ask them to stop or adjust their technique at any time and for any reason. We never want you to be uncomfortable on our tables. You will never be asked for an explanation or receive resistance from a professional therapist - we are here to serve you and your preferences are paramount to us. These preferences are used to build a personalized treatment tailored to you and your body. I'm so sorry that we weren't a good fit, but I appreciate you giving Now and Zen a try! If you would like a referral to another highly skilled and professional therapist that might be a better fit for you please email me at Ariana@yourzenmassage.com and I can provide you with a list of well recommended local colleagues. Have a wonderful day!"
"We do not have you as a patient in our database nor do we have you as a guardian or responsible party on anyone’s account. Sorry!7/17/2018Previous reviewWhat a horrible company. We had an insurance claim where the insurance company agreed to pay AZ Family Dentistry due to an injury. We had AZ Family Dentistry replace a crown. While many dentists can replace a crown in a day, AZ Dentistry put in a temporary crown while we waited 5 weeks for the permanent crown to come in. During this process the temporary crown fell out twice! After finally receiving the permanent crown, it fell out after a week! Clearly, someone doesn't know what they're doing. Fast forward a few weeks. We are still negotiating a settlement with the insurance and receive a voicemail from Peggy that she will be calling the police on us and filing a claim for theft of goods and services. How unprofessional. They were aware this was an insurance claim and she even spoke to the insurance company to verify before working on us. I'm not sure how the insurance company and us working on a settlement is stealing from her. Lastly, when I called to discuss the horrible voicemail she left us, she yelled at me and hung up. How do businesses like this even stay in business. Ridiculous. Please reference photos to view her voicemail"
"Hi Dennis, it's great to hear that you have enjoyed coming in to see us and love our suits. We will pass along your comments to Drake and the team!"
"Hi Mark, We're sorry to hear about your frustrations with your order. Since there are no additional fitting appointments while your suit is being constructed, we work backwards and make adjustments to the finished garments to achieve your ideal fit. Once your profile is updated with the new measurements, future orders will fit out of the box and you will not have to go through the same process again. When ordering for a special event, we recommend ordering 6 weeks in advance to have enough time for any adjustments. We can see that your remake suit has been submitted, please reach out to our team if you have any further issues."
"Hi Christopher, thanks for the glowing review! We're so glad to hear working with Nas was such a good experience for you, and we look forward to working with you again, too. We hope you enjoy the new suit."

"Don't be fooled, investing in a made-to-measure suit (a.k.a. custom suit) is not the same as investing in a bespoke suitThe truth is that made-to-measure suits still conform to a design template being mass-produced by a company to make its sales.Brands that offer made-to-measure suits have made the process a fairly easy and a quick one for all types of men. Measurements taken by a consultant or calculated by an online tailoring system are sent off to a factory machine that is programmed to know basic proportions. In a matter of days, the suit is ready for wear. If additional alterations are required, they might be done on site, but these days little or no hand-made elements are incorporated into the assembly of a made-to-measure suit.Ultimately, the effort in creating a suit that is unique to a single wearer is lost in the made-to-measure process. The one-on-one consultations between client and tailor are compromised to simply submitting measurements, picking a lining, choosing some buttons and possibly having the suit monogrammed. Other than that, you end up with a swatch that has been customized to fit you in the best way it can.There is nothing wrong with purchasing a made-to measure suit and here are a few pros:- Affordable- Personalized- StylishI ordered a 'made to measure suit' from Indochino last year and here is my experience with this company.The consultant was friendly and knowledgeable about the products. The process begins with selecting a material, buttons, a lining, a suit jacket style (i.e single or double breasted), notch style, vent, etc. They than proceeded to take my measurements which is also available online through the website. In the end, I was happy with my experience and was anxious to receive my suit which they shipped directly to my home.Unfortunately when I did receive my suit, the suit length was cut so short it looked like I was wearing a toddlers jacket. There was a few other minor issues, sleeve length and pant length but I chalk this up to inexperience from the consultant. Indochino, at no extra cost, had the minor issues tailored and replaced the jacket with a properly measure jacket.Overall, if you are a first timer looking to have a 'made to measure' suit or 'custom suit' made, I would recommend Indochino.Useful 13Funny 1CoolBusiness owner informationChris T.Business Manager3/29/2016Pat, Thanks for taking the time to write a such an informative and refreshing review.  I'm glad that in the end we got your fit right, but please feel free to reach out if you ever need anything else.Warm regards,Josesocial@indochino.com"

"My dad wanted to get me something different for my birthday this year and an escape room was suggested by my aunt. I had never given much thought to escape rooms but it sounded interesting enough so the research began. And let me tell you, there is plenty to research. There are so many escape rooms in Las Vegas. I looked at several and the room I was most interested in was the Western room at Lockdown Flamingo. So my dad booked it for three of us. He and a friend of mine accompanied me.Neither of us had done an escape room before so we didn't know what to expect. We started with a briefing of the rules and watched an informational video giving us the back story of the room. We were then taken into the room and our 1 hour clock was started. The three of us were split into two jail cells which we had to break out of. I'm not going to say we cheated but we did not fully complete the first couple of puzzles. It was taking too damn long to get to the meat of the challenge. Once we were out of the cells we were on to the good puzzles that had more clues with which to work. We were on the right track with most everything and maybe even figured out a couple of clues but we were starting to run out of time. 45 minutes were gone and and we were given our 15 minute warning. But we weren't anywhere close to unlocking the final locks. Then we remembered we were allowed three clues. We used them. I'm not even going to lie. After the first two we were on top of our game. We knew exactly what to do for the last clue. Or maybe not. We used that third clue and with that the final lock was opened. We found the giant key and recovered the stolen totems thereby ending the cursed drought. All with four minutes to spare. Phew.This experience started out frustrating as all hell. But once we started finding our groove it became a lot of fun. What I am most fascinated by is the attention to detail. The thought that must go into creating the puzzles is staggering. Plus the atmosphere was spot on. It was dark as if in an 1880s jail lit by lantern. The headdress and arrows. Wanted posters and furniture. Everything matched the theme of the room. I appreciate the care that went in to this. Without giving anything away, if you come here or any escape room I imagine, be sure to bring your attention to detail. As they say, the devil is in the details. Things that seem inconsequential may have the biggest impact in either solving or not solving the puzzle and thus escaping the room.Useful 2Funny 1Cool 2Business owner informationMelissa O.Business Manager8/29/2018Thank you so much for your detailed review, Jared!

"We are escape room junkies and have over 100 rooms under our belt with record times. We have solved our share of hard puzzles, but for some reason we didn't get the Mayan room. There was a piece in the room we tried several times and nothing happened. It made us look at other things...we finally asked for a clue and sure enough we needed to use that piece. We tried to get it to work for awhile and then he finally came in..he had a hard time but he got it to give us the next clue...I think that spoiled it for us, pulled us out of the game play...and was uber disappointing. There were a few other snafus in the other room as well..it just led you to failure If you went a different direction...we like difficult rooms which is why we selected this one...but it just wasn't that fun. It also had zero tech in there and we are big suckers for technology.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationMelissa O.Business Manager8/29/2018Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review.

"Five stars all the way for this property! I stay here at least a couple of times a year, and for one of Marriott's limited service brands, the staff here really go out of their way. For example, when I changed reservations in the middle of our stay, they got me a better room and actually moved our luggage to the new room while we were out for the day. They also address me by name when I come and go. In particular, the woman at the front desk on weekday mornings is delightful, as are the two guys who work overnight.  I had even provided some constructive feedback the last time I stayed, and one of them remembered me and still treated me very kindly.  Even at the breakfast, the woman comes over, clears my plate, and asks if she can get me anything else. I have never had anybody speak to me at a limited service hotel morning breakfast buffet before!I also observe whenever I am in the lobby. This level of service is not just provided to me because I am gold elite.  Everyone is greeted with a smile, a kind word and a willingness to help.UsefulFunnyCoolBusiness owner informationHotel M.Business Manager3/24/2018Dear Brian F.Thank you for taking the time to review SpringHill Suites Scottsdale North.

"Traveling for business, this completely meets my needs for a clean and comfortable hotel in the Scottsdale area. Cleanliness is a number one MUST and this place fits the bill. I am not sure how old the hotel is, but it feels fresh/new enough.I did not hear or see anyone else on my floor, however the parking lot was full, and breakfast had plenty of people. Translation... it's comfortable and quiet, even when it's busy.I didn't have time to try the free breakfast, but it looked like there was plenty of room and tables (I've seen other places lack this before). There are plenty of dining options nearby, but only a couple that are within a quick walk. Just a heads-up in case you are traveling without a vehicle/rental.If I had a need to visit Scottsdale with my family (hubby and tweens), I'd likely use this hotel, seemed very family friendly.Useful 2FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationHotel M.Business Manager11/16/2017Dear Rebecca,Thank you for recommending us to future guests.

"Hi Emily.  We’re sorry that u had a negative experience at our salon.  Regarding the fungus on your middle finger, it is rather difficult to determine the cause.  Typically this happens when there’s lifting on acrylics.  And lifting can happen when a patron does not get refill on time.  It is recommended that refill should be done every 2-3 weeks.  Base on your purchase history, you’ve gone beyond 4 weeks in between refills.  The last technician who serviced you has more than 20 years of experience and she never had any fungus issue.  We would be glad to take care of your next refill with compensation, regardless of the cause of fungus.  However, refund is not an option because our services are NOT refundable.  We wish you the best and remind you not to go beyond 2-3 weeks between refills."
Thank you and we look forward to seeing you again
"Hello.  I am the owner of First Class Limousine Service, established in 1985.  First let me say that I am VERY sorry that you were disappointed in the service you received from my driver.  Being in business for almost 32 years, surely, our services are very dependable, or I wouldn't be in business this long, particularly in that we service the largest universities, hospitals, museums, businesses, etc.  It's a difficult business to be perfect at, but we try very hard.That said, I'd like to address the specific issues of Kelly M:The property where where we were scheduled to pick Kelly up for an airport transfer is an old style apartment building that operates as a hotel, therefore there is no front desk, of sorts.  There is no way to enter the building.and the office is a block down the street in another one of their 5 or 6 buildings,  At these properties, the drivers are instructed to sit in the vehicle until the passenger comes out.  The driver was on site 13 minutes before the scheduled pick-up time, which I verified with our vehicle GPS tracking.  At the scheduled pick-up time, the driver (who has been with me over 10 years) called the main office of the property.  The office clerk phoned the room twice, but, nobody answered.  So, the driver waited.When Kelly M. finally reached me about 15 minutes later, she was EXTREMELY hot under the collar!  I apologized to her, and told her that the car was simply sitting in the driveway.  By the time she walked outside to to the driver, she was VERY upset, which set off an unfortunate, and likely avoidable, verbal exchange with the driver.  Supposedly, she violently threw her bag(s) in the trunk.  The driver (claims) he tried to de-escalate the situation, suggesting to her that she ""forget all of that, and let's go""!  I'm sure it could have been handled better, and I DO apologize for that!  Believe me!I believe the entire incident could have been avoided if my driver had simply walked up to the front door to the building, or if Kelly had simply walked outside the building to see that the car was sitting in the driveway.Kelly, as I said to you on the phone, I'm VERY sorry that you had this problem with my employee, as this is certainly not the norm.  That said, you were upset that the driver didn't call your cell phone to tell you he was there.  In practice, we normally don't do this until 15 minutes has passed from the pickup time, as people are usually finishing packing, or eating.Once again, if you read my other reviews, you will find NOTHING even close to a story like this.  One thing my company is known for, above all else, is having extremely friendly drivers.  To say that women shouldn't use my service, I believe, is a little over the top, as, some of the most prominent women in Pittsburgh are long-time customers of mine.Thanks for taking the time to read my reply.DSEdited to add:  I wish Kelly would add how she praised us over the phone, because of how readily we accommodated her when she arrived at PIT airport 3 days earlier, when her flight routing was changed twice with minimal notice, from 7:42 PM to 9:39 PM, then to 11:20 PM.In response to your comment about the driver being late:  Your flight arrived 20 minutes early.  I remember CLEARLY when I spoke to you on the phone from the airport.  You were very understanding, and quite happy to wait a few minutes while I called the driver, and I got the two of you together in less than 5 minutes.Further reply:  I apologized to you 3 times in my reply above, for anything my driver may have said to you that upset you, and multiple times on the phone.  I'm really not sure what else you would like me to do for you at this point.  I have spoken with the driver, but I can't vouch for anything specific that was said to you during your interaction, as I wasn't there.That said, the personal attacks you made about me, are unsubstantiated, COMPLETELY without merit, and simply, don't dignify a response from me."
"This is simply a case of mistaken identity. . . .Hello, I am the owner of First Class Limousine Service, established 1985.During almost 32 years in business, I have NEVER had a limo bus - of ANY type!  Nearly 100% of our business is airport transfers in regular everyday type sedans.There is another First Class Limousine Service from somewhere in West Virginia or Ohio that services Pittsburgh with limo buses, that has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with my company.  I frequently get their erroneous phone calls.DS"

"April, I know we had emailed each other back in February. I'm not sure why Yelp just alerted me of your public review. I am sorry that you had such a bad experience.  Pour Painting has been on the rise and there are a LOT of people doing things differently.  My objective of this class/workshop is to give everyone a taste of what it's like.  The one you attended was my 1st attempt at offering it to my customers.  I admit, I didn't expect so many people to sign up and that so much of my materials would be used.  As far as the quality of paint, etc. we use the same paint that most other paint & sip studios use.  Almost everyone from that class reached out to me for additional pour painting classes.  Since then, I have learned not to allow so many people in each class and I have made the process much simpler.  For the record, only 1 person brought her own heat tool. She is a personal friend of mine and an artist.  Again, my apologies."
"So I just joined yesterday and I have to say this gym is NICE!!! So as you all know the gyms all across the US has been closed due to Covid-19. I just moved to this state about a week ago however in Jersey (Jersey girl!) the gyms opened up about 2 weeks ago. Needless to say, I needed to get back in the gym (as safely as possible) ASAP!First let's start off with, this gym is HUGE! When I first walked in I was automatically greeted by the gentleman at the front desk. Alex (who was AMAZING btw) showed me around and was very patient with me while I asked a ton of questions. Afterwards, I had to ask the million dollar question ""How Much Is it per month!!??""  The answer I was given blew me away- $10 A MONTH! I could not believe it! I even told them I wasn't looking for a contract because I didn't want to be locked in and guess what?????? He still said it was $10 A MONTH for all of this! (See pics). Today was the first day that I worked out and was very satisfied. The machines/facilities were clean, staff was helpful and made sure people wore their masks. They even had a ""woman's section"" where women could work out comfortably and with other women If they should choose. Overall, great gym - glad I joined!See all photos from Uneka H. for Fitness Connection - UniversityUseful 11Funny 4Cool 8Business owner informationRobin F.Business Manager9/22/2020Hi, Uneka.

"Had my first experience at Fitness Connection. My friend works out here and suggested I try the 5 day Fitness pass. Pulling out to the facility at 7:00pm, the gym was super packed. I presume this would be the case because the time was so late. But the number of people in the faculty was overwhelming. I had trouble accessing my free pass online, so in route to the location I contacted I was able to locate a treadmill on the first row which was nice. I did my 20 minutes until my friend arrived. Once she arrived I joined her in what I call the chaos jungle. It was an absolute madhouse in the weight/machine area. So many people using machines, not cleaning them properly and worst of all leaving weights ALL OVER THE GYM! No common courtesy for the next person that possibly wants to use them. And staff wasn't anywhere around to address the matter. What normally take an hour for me to workout took and hour and thirty minutes It was the worst. I used my 5 day pass that day only. I don't plan to return...Useful 7Funny 2Cool 2Business owner informationRobin F.Business Manager8/3/2018Hi Anisha,Thank you for your valuable feedback.

Thank you for your feedback. We have made changes to our contracted billing service and our clients are very happy with our new billing service.
". Her practice worked with the  insurance I had at the time. It was a one-time, 5-minute visit for an RX refill, as I changed jobs and had to find a new doctor. I never heard a peep from this office again. Fast forward 2.5 years, and here we are. I just received a call this morning from a debt collector, telling me I owe $185 in bills. I've NEVER received a bill from this office (I would never not pay a doctor's bill), and despite talking to the office, the billing department and the debt collector, not a single person is able to provide a breakdown of the cost of my visit. My insurance covered an additional $145 of this bill - So what I'm really wondering is a) What happened in that 5 minute visit to warrant a total of $300+????? and b) WHY DID I NEVER RECEIVE A BILL? Turns out - they wrote my address down wrong. Now I owe a debt collector $185 for a 5 minute visit in a dingy office to get an rx refill of a medication I had been taking for over 5 years.Useful 2FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationAlexis G.Business Employee11/11/2019Thank you for your feedback.

". How does a patient who comes in routinely, suddenly have $500 worth of bill that are two years old!? The employee told me, if I can't pay about half of what I owe, I can't have my appointment with the doctor. I told her, cancel my appointment then. I asked the billing person to send me an itemized list of all of my visits and billing from 2016 to present. That was about a month ago. Haven't received the letter with any details. I've been getting called by a debt collector instead. I may need to contact my old insurance to check the claims.

"Thank you for your feedback. We care about our patients. We are very pleased that your finally feel better.10/26/2015Previous reviewDr. Modesta-Keyhani is friendly and knowledgeable, appears to have a very solid medical background, and it is fairly easy to schedule quick appointments.  Unfortunately, those are the only positives in my 6 weeks working with this clinic.While the doctor is friendly and capable, I really got the impression that she is incredibly overbooked and this showed in the service I received.  Every appointment I had was extremely hurried, which made it really difficult to process information and ask questions.  I left appointments feeling confused and like my case wasn't given the attention it needed.  It seems like they are trying to churn out as many patients as possible, rather than giving proper time and attention to fewer patients.  One particular frustration is that any time I had test results, I had to come in for an in-person appointment instead of just receiving a phone call letting me know what results meant.  This resulted in 3 appointments that I felt were completely unnecessary and could've been handled by phone.  That may be office policy, but I've had doctors in the past who call with test results and that just saves everyone time and frustration.Even more than this, my main qualm is with the support staff and with repeated mistakes made by them.  While they are friendly, they seem to not know what's going on most of the time.  My first round of blood and urine samples were lost with no explanation, no one had any idea who had handled them or where they had gone (which is totally unsettling...where did my blood go??).  I had to come back in to correct this, a real inconvenience considering the 30 minute drive and 12 hours of fasting.  Recently, the doctor ordered an out-of-office procedure for me and I was told that I would be contacted by the specialist in one or two days to schedule, and after not hearing anything for a week I called Shafa to follow up only to find that the paperwork hadn't been sent to the specialist until 5 days later.  It was just a simple fax.  I can't count how many times I heard ""oh...I don't know what happened, I don't know how that works"", etc. in my really basic questions to them.My 6 weeks at this clinic were very frustrating, and I am going to look elsewhere for a PCP."

"At this location I had my first experience with a lady sales(wo)man. Everytime I go to a dealership, it is only men. Maddy assisted me and she did amazing. I felt so much more comfortable talking to her than I have felt with male salesmen. She wasn't intimidating, didn't bully me into a purchase nor was she pushy. However, She was still very effective at her job. She followed through with all of the things she told me she would do. Texted me from both her work number and personal cell number. Kept great communication throughout.She went above and beyond by offerring me incentives for a brand new car that I hadn't even known about at all. I went in for a freaking used 2012 Honda CRV from their inventory, got paperwork started on a 2021 Toyota Rav 4 instead! Maddy was a pleasure to work with. I definitely recommend to anyone!

"We would have loved to help this person clear her skin and I am truly sorry it did not work out that way and for any misunderstanding. We sincerely hope she finds what she is looking for. We specialize in acne and problem skin. We do not provide any pampering services as stated on our website. We also do not provide false hope. We love what we do and we do it with honesty and integrity. To treat most skin conditions we do consultations, advise lifestyle changes, customize corrective home care products, and provide professional treatments. When people come to see us with skin care issues that cannot be resolved in one treatment we offer them a 1 hour detailed consultation for $35 where we discuss all of the above and more. Our clients are given AM/PM Home Care instructions, cheat sheets, and ongoing skin care coaching. Our consultations include periodic follow-up visits at no extra charge while using our products. This is what we offer to all of our clients. We care deeply in the success of our clients obtaining clear skin. Our clients appreciate what we offer and we sincerely appreciate them in return.
